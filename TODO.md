- **Performance Regression**: Maintain benchmark suite, performance gates
- **Integration Delays**: Keep mockS functional while replacing incrementally

### Business Risks
- **Customer Validation**: Start outreach immediately, parallel track
- **Competitive Threats**: File provisional patents ASAP
- **Team Scaling**: Begin recruiting conversations early

### Fundraise Risks
- **Valuation Justification**: Strong technical proof points required
- **Timeline Pressure**: Parallel track all activities
- **DD Preparation**: Start data room organization now

## ðŸ“ž NEXT ACTIONS (Today)

1. **Technical**: Start Docker build fixes immediately
2. **Narrative**: Begin extracting BOOK1.md philosophy 
3. **Validation**: Create code-to-claim mapping spreadsheet
4. **Business**: Schedule first customer discovery calls
5. **Legal**: Contact patent attorney about provisional filings
