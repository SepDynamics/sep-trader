# SEP Financial Engine: DSL-Driven Trading System TODO

## Executive Summary

This TODO outlines the strategic rebase of the **SEP Financial Engine** from hardcoded C++ trading logic to a **DSL-driven pattern-based trading system**. The goal is to leverage the production-ready SEP DSL (61/61 tests passing) to create a flexible, configurable trading platform where trading strategies are expressed as DSL patterns rather than compiled code.

**Current State**: Production-ready financial engine (60.73% high-confidence accuracy) + Complete DSL infrastructure
**Target State**: DSL-driven trading platform where all trading logic is expressed as patterns
