# Test Suite Overview

This directory summarizes the layout of the test suite.

## Unit
Focused checks for individual components. Current coverage targets core engine logic, utility helpers, I/O surfaces, and application wrappers.

## Integration
End-to-end flows combining multiple modules. These tests validate that subsystems interoperate correctly.

## Performance
Benchmarks measuring computational throughput and latency for critical paths.
