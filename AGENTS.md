# AGENTS Instructions

The project currently builds successfully; focus is on constructing the test suite.

- Place new tests under `tests/` using GoogleTest via `add_sep_test`.
- Run `ctest` when modifying code or adding tests.
- Documentation or configuration updates do not require running the full build.
- Use the existing binaries in `bin/` as functional references when planning tests.
