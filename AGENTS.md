# AGENTS Instructions

- Keep documentation consistent with configuration files under `config/` and the binaries produced in `bin/`.
- Add new tests under `tests/` using GoogleTest via `add_sep_test`.
- Run `ctest` whenever source code or tests change; documentation-only updates do not require it.
- The web UI lives in `frontend/` and deployment scripts expect the compiled targets in `bin/`.
