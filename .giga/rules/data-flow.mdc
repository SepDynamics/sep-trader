# data-flow

## Core Data Pipeline Components

### Pattern Processing Pipeline
Location: src/core/pattern_processor.cpp
Importance: 95/100

Data flows through distinct phases:
1. Raw market data ingestion
2. Quantum bit-field transformation
3. Pattern coherence calculation
4. State transition analysis
5. Signal generation

Key transformations:
- Market data -> 64-bit quantum states
- States -> Pattern matrices
- Matrices -> Coherence scores
- Coherence -> Trading signals

### Memory Tier Transitions
Location: src/util/memory_tier_manager.cpp
Importance: 85/100

Pattern data flows between memory tiers:
1. Short-term Memory (STM)
- Volatile patterns
- High coherence threshold
- Rapid state transitions

2. Medium-term Memory (MTM) 
- Semi-stable patterns
- Moderate coherence
- Periodic state evaluation

3. Long-term Memory (LTM)
- Stable patterns
- High stability score
- Rare state changes

### Quantum State Pipeline
Location: src/quantum/qfh_processor.cpp
Importance: 90/100

State transformation sequence:
1. Raw bit patterns -> Quantum states
2. State evolution through harmonics analysis
3. Coherence measurement and filtering
4. Pattern collapse prediction
5. Signal confidence scoring

Data flows between states using:
- Quantum Field Harmonics (QFH)
- Bit Transition Harmonics (BTH)
- Pattern Evolution Tracking (PET)

### System Interaction Flow
Location: src/apps/trader/signal_bridge.cpp
Importance: 80/100

Data path through trading system:
1. Market data ingestion
2. Pattern detection pipeline
3. Memory tier management
4. Quantum state analysis
5. Signal generation
6. Trade execution
