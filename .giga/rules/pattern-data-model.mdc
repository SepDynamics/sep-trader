# pattern-data-model

## Pattern Structure
- Base quantum bit string (64-bit) encodes market state transitions
- Hierarchical pattern storage with confidence metrics
- Evolution tracking through state matrices
- Pattern coherence calculated via quantum field harmonics

## Core Components

### Pattern Evolution Engine
Path: src/core/pattern_evolution.cpp
Importance Score: 95/100
- Tracks pattern lifecycle through quantum states:
  - NULL_STATE: Initial pattern formation
  - FLIP: Market direction change
  - RUPTURE: Pattern breakdown
- Manages pattern breeding and mutation
- Implements coherence decay formula: Î» = k1 * Entropy + k2 * (1 - Coherence)

### Memory Tier Management
Path: src/util/memory_tier_manager.cpp
Importance Score: 85/100
- Three-tier pattern storage (STM/MTM/LTM)
- Pattern promotion based on coherence scores
- Relationship strength tracking between patterns
- Cross-timeframe pattern synchronization

### Pattern Metrics Engine
Path: src/core/pattern_metric_engine.cpp
Importance Score: 90/100
- Calculates core quantum metrics:
  - Coherence: Market state alignment
  - Stability: Pattern persistence
  - Entropy: State disorder level
- Implements confidence scoring: Score = (Coherence * 0.4 + Stability * 0.3 + (1-Entropy) * 0.3)

### Pattern Relationships
Path: src/core/pattern_processor.cpp
Importance Score: 80/100
- Tracks pattern dependencies and correlations
- Manages pattern breeding pools
- Handles pattern inheritance across timeframes
- Implements quantum entanglement detection

## Data Model Evolution

### State Transitions
- Patterns evolve through quantum-inspired state changes
- Transition probabilities tracked via coherence metrics
- Pattern strength decays according to market entropy

### Cross-Pattern Relationships
- Hierarchical pattern dependencies
- Timeframe synchronization (M1/M5/M15)
- Pattern breeding based on success metrics
- Quantum correlation tracking
