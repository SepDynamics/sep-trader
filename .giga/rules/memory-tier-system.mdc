# memory-tier-system

Memory Tier Architecture:
- Three-tier memory hierarchy: STM (Short-term), MTM (Medium-term), LTM (Long-term)
- Tier-specific coherence thresholds: LTM (0.8), MTM (0.5), STM (0.2)
- Block migration based on coherence, stability and access patterns

Pattern Management Logic:
1. Pattern Classification
- Coherence scoring (0.0-1.0) based on quantum state stability
- Generation counting for pattern maturity tracking
- Relationship strength calculation between patterns

2. Promotion/Demotion Rules
- Promotion criteria:
  * STM → MTM: coherence ≥ 0.5, 5+ generations
  * MTM → LTM: coherence ≥ 0.8, 50+ generations 
- Demotion triggers:
  * Low coherence (below tier threshold)
  * Memory pressure (>0.8 utilization)
  * Pattern fragmentation

3. Block Allocation Strategy 
- Multi-factor scoring for placement:
  * Coherence (40% weight)
  * Stability (30% weight) 
  * Access frequency (20% weight)
  * Entanglement density (10% weight)
- Hysteresis prevention using minimum residency periods

4. Pattern Storage Implementation
- Quantum state preservation during tier transitions
- Relationship graph maintenance across tiers
- Entanglement tracking between related patterns
- Phase correlation preservation during migrations

5. Memory Pressure Optimization
- Selective demotion of 20% lowest coherence patterns
- Automatic defragmentation at 0.8 pressure threshold
- Pattern compaction with relationship preservation
- Minimum coherence floor (0.1) for persistence

Key Components:
- src/memory/memory_tier_manager.cpp
- src/memory/quantum_coherence_manager.cpp
- src/memory/pattern_storage.cpp
- src/cache/cache_validator.cpp

The system implements quantum-inspired memory management focused on pattern coherence and stability across different retention periods. The unique value lies in maintaining quantum properties while enabling efficient pattern evolution and relationship preservation.
