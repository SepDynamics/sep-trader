# memory-tier-system

## Memory Tier Architecture
Path: src/util/memory_tier.hpp, src/util/memory_tier_manager.hpp

Three-tier memory organization for quantum pattern storage:
- Short-Term Memory (STM): High-speed volatile pattern cache
- Medium-Term Memory (MTM): Intermediate stability patterns 
- Long-Term Memory (LTM): Stable, proven trading patterns

## Pattern Promotion/Demotion Logic
Path: src/util/memory_tier_manager.cpp

Pattern lifecycle rules:
- STM -> MTM promotion requires:
  - Coherence score > 0.65
  - Stability index > 0.45
  - Minimum 100 trades
- MTM -> LTM promotion requires:
  - Coherence score > 0.85
  - Stability index > 0.75
  - Profit factor > 1.5
  - Minimum 500 trades

Demotion triggers:
- Coherence drop > 20%
- Stability index below threshold
- Negative profit factor over 50 trades

## Redis Integration
Path: src/util/redis_manager.cpp

Pattern persistence strategy:
- STM patterns cached locally only
- MTM patterns synced every 5 minutes
- LTM patterns synced immediately on state change
- Pattern serialization with quantum state preservation
- Cross-node pattern sharing with coherence validation

## Block Management
Path: src/core/pattern_cache.cpp

Memory allocation strategy:
- Dynamic block sizing based on pattern complexity
- Quantum state preservation during block transfers
- Pattern relationship preservation across tiers
- Block defragmentation with coherence maintenance
- Lazy garbage collection for expired patterns

Importance Score: 95/100
