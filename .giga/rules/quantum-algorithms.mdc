# quantum-algorithms

The quantum algorithm implementation centers around three core components:

1. Quantum Binary State Analysis (QBSA)
- Pattern state classification: NULL_STATE, FLIP, RUPTURE
- Binary transition tracking for collapse prediction
- Probe index analysis for pattern integrity validation
- Correction ratio calculations for quantum coherence

2. Quantum Field Harmonics (QFH)
- Dynamic damping calculation: λ = k1 * Entropy + k2 * (1 - Coherence)
- Exponential damping formula: V_i = Σ(p_j - p_i) * e^(-λ(j-i))
- Multi-timeframe analysis across M1/M5/M15 intervals
- Pattern classification with coherence thresholds:
  * Stable: coherence >= 0.7
  * Transitional: 0.3 <= coherence < 0.7
  * Unstable: coherence < 0.3

3. Pattern Evolution System
- Quantum manifold optimization using Riemannian geometry
- Cross-timeframe pattern alignment with phase correlation
- Evolution tracking through quantum state transitions
- Pattern coherence preservation across generations

Implementation Paths:
- src/quantum/qbsa.cpp: Core QBSA implementation
- src/quantum/qfh.cpp: QFH analysis engine
- src/quantum/pattern_evolution.cpp: Pattern evolution system

Core Parameters:
- Stability weight: 0.4 (with inversion logic)
- Coherence weight: 0.1 (minimal influence)
- Entropy weight: 0.5 (primary driver)
- Confidence threshold: 0.65
- Coherence threshold: 0.30

The system achieves 60.73% prediction accuracy through quantum-inspired pattern analysis, with a 19.1% optimal signal generation rate. Pattern analysis occurs in quantum bit-space using specialized CUDA kernels for parallel processing.
