# Visual TODO

- [ ] Define plain‑spoken explanations for entropy, stability, and coherence.
- [ ] Draft time‑series mockups showing the three metrics converging.
- [ ] Explore 3D manifold scatter using `react-three-fiber`.
- [ ] Design radial bands for "hot", "warm", and "cold" zones.
- [ ] Plot rupture histograms to highlight sudden shifts.
- [ ] Map the pipeline from tick data to visual output.
- [ ] Create an identity inspector mockup for drill‑down details.
- [ ] Collect demo data or synthetic samples for offline viewing.
- [ ] Document each visual with a short 3Blue1Brown‑style narrative.
