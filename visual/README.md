# SEP Visual Playground

Imagine tracing the path of a single idea as it dances through a landscape of entropy, stability, and coherence.  This folder is a staging ground for 3Blue1Brown‑style visuals that make those dances tangible.  Think of each metric as a color on a canvas and every update as a frame in an animation.

## Purpose
- Provide a home for visual explanations of SEP's manifold.
- Share high‑school‑friendly narratives that marry geometry with intuition.
- Serve as a launchpad for frontend components, mockups, and demo data.

## 3Blue1Brown Influence
Our tone aims to echo 3Blue1Brown: "See how randomness swirls into structure" and "let the geometry guide the algebra."  When charts arrive, they should feel like the next frame of an animation—smooth, colorful, and story‑driven.

## Directory Layout
- `mockups/` – sketches or static diagrams that capture an intuition before code.
- `assets/` – images, snippets, or animation frames that survive past prototypes.
- `TODO.md` – evolving checklist of visual tasks.

## Next Steps
1. Draft intuitive descriptions of entropy, stability, and coherence.
2. Sketch the metric time‑series and manifold scatter in `mockups/`.
3. Prototype interactive components in the frontend once mockups feel right.

"If you can picture the dance, you can write the steps."  This space is for crafting that picture.
