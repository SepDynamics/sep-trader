# SEP Dynamics Professional Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Automated Packaging
```bash
./package.sh v1.0.0
```

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Build engine
./build.sh

# Deploy website
cd website && npm ci && npm run build
```

## 📦 Release Process

### 1. Create Release Tag
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### 2. Automated Release Pipeline
The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- Build and test the SEP Engine
- Package the commercial distribution
- Build and deploy the website
- Create GitHub release with assets

### 3. Manual Release (if needed)
```bash
./package.sh v1.0.0
# Upload release/sep-engine-v1.0.0.tar.gz to customers
```

## 🏗️ Self-Hosted Runner Configuration

The repository uses a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner for:
- Full control over build environment
- Access to CUDA acceleration
- Secure deployment capabilities

Runner status:
```bash
systemctl --user status actions.runner.service
```

## 🌐 Website Deployment

### Production Website
- **URL**: [sepdynamics.com](https://sepdynamics.com)
- **Deployment**: Automated via GitHub Actions
- **Source**: `website/` directory
- **Build**: Vite production build

### Local Development
```bash
cd website
npm install
npm run dev
# Opens on http://localhost:3000
```
