# Mock Implementation Inventory

## Overview

This document tracks the ongoing inventory of mock implementations across the SEP Engine codebase, as part of the mock implementation consolidation strategy outlined in `docs/mock_implementation_strategy.md`.

## Initial Findings

During our initial scan, we identified the following mock implementations and related patterns:

### Detection Mechanisms

1. **Placeholder Detection** (`_sep/testbed/placeholder_detection.h`)
   - Runtime mechanism to detect and reject placeholder values in production code
   - Controlled via `SEP_STRICT_PLACEHOLDER_CHECK` environment variable
   - Used to ensure development placeholders don't make it to production

### Data Source Mocks

1. **OANDA Market Data Helper**
   - Previously located at `_sep/testbed/oanda_market_data_helper.hpp` with a placeholder ATR value
   - Now integrated into `src/app/quantum_signal_bridge.cpp` with real ATR computation

2. **Cache Validation** (Referenced in `tests/data_pipeline/test_data_integrity.cpp`)
   - Ensures cached entries originate from recognized providers (e.g., OANDA)
   - Stub provider references removed to prevent mock data usage

### Test Verification

1. **Data Integrity Tests** (`tests/data_pipeline/test_data_integrity.cpp`)
   - Tests verify that real OANDA data is used instead of simulated data
   - Tests check that DSL uses real QFH engine rather than mock values
   - Tests verify manifold optimizer uses real components
   - Tests confirm no hardcoded simulation values in critical paths

### Service Architecture

1. **Service Interfaces** (now under `src/app`)
   - Core service interfaces consolidated into application layer:
     - `IQuantumProcessingService`
     - `IPatternRecognitionService`
     - `ITradingLogicService`
     - `IDataAccessService`
   - Legacy `src/services` directory removed during cleanup

## Next Steps

1. Perform deeper static analysis with tools to identify:
   - Classes with naming patterns matching `*Mock*`, `*Stub*`, `*Fake*`, `*Dummy*`, `*Test*`
   - Files in test directories with potential mock implementations
   - Classes with testing-related preprocessor directives

2. Conduct runtime component analysis:
   - Identify singleton patterns that could be replaced with injectable dependencies
   - Map component dependencies
   - Analyze initialization patterns to find hardcoded dependencies

3. Complete the implementation inventory with:
   - Location in codebase
   - Purpose/role
   - Dependencies
   - Current usage
   - Potential consolidation approach

## Inventory Progress

| Component | Location | Type | Purpose | Status |
|-----------|----------|------|---------|--------|
| PlaceholderDetection | `_sep/testbed/placeholder_detection.h` | Utility | Detect placeholder values in production | Identified |
| OandaMarketDataHelper | `src/app/quantum_signal_bridge.cpp` | Helper | Fetches OANDA data with ATR calculation | Resolved |
| CacheValidator | Referenced in tests | Validation | Validate real data providers | Updated |
| ServiceInterfaces | `src/app/*` | Interface | Define service contracts | Consolidated |
| MemoryTierServiceStub | `src/app/MemoryTierService.*` | Service | Mock memory tier management | Removed |

## Integration with Consolidation Strategy

This inventory will directly support Phase 1 (Interface Definition) and Phase 2 (Mock Framework Creation) of the Mock Implementation Consolidation Strategy. The inventory data will be used to create the comprehensive Mock Implementation Registry defined in the strategy document.
