# Documentation Consolidation TODO

- Verify each section in `docs/README.md` for accuracy and update outdated details.
- Replace deleted `README.md` references within source files or scripts with links to the consolidated docs.
- Standardize formatting and style across all documentation.
- Continue consolidating code modules to reduce duplication and improve maintainability.
- Move experimental code into `/_sep/testbed/` for validation before merging into core components.
