# SEP Proof of Concept

**Last Updated:** August 20, 2025

This document summarizes the series of proofs-of-concept (PoCs) that demonstrate the evolution and validation of the SEP Engine.

## 1. PoC 1: Datatype-Agnostic Ingestion and Coherence Quantification

*   **Objective:** To prove that the engine can process any file as a raw stream of bytes and distinguish between repetitive, random, and structured data.
*   **Methodology:** The `pattern_metric_example` executable was used to process a text file, a binary file with repetitive data, and a binary file with random data.
*   **Results:** The engine successfully processed all files and assigned coherence scores that accurately reflected the nature of the data (1.0 for repetitive, 0.0561 for random, and 0.5 for text).

## 2. PoC 2: Stateful Processing, Coherence Stability, and State Clearing

*   **Objective:** To demonstrate that the engine can retain its internal state across multiple processing runs, correctly identify and assign a stable coherence score to repetitive data, and be reset on command.
*   **Methodology:** The `pattern_metric_example` executable was run multiple times on a repetitive data file, with and without clearing the state between runs.
*   **Results:** The engine's internal state (pattern count) grew with each iteration when not cleared, and was successfully reset when the clearing mechanism was used. The coherence score remained stable at 1.0.

## 3. PoC 3: Analysis of a Compiled Executable

*   **Objective:** To demonstrate the engine's flexibility by analyzing a compiled binary executable.
*   **Methodology:** The `pattern_metric_example` executable was used to process an arbitrary executable file.
*   **Results:** The engine successfully processed the file and produced a mid-range coherence score of 0.4682, accurately reflecting the semi-structured nature of the file.

## 4. PoC 4: Baseline Performance Benchmark

*   **Objective:** To establish a baseline performance metric for the core SEP Engine.
*   **Methodology:** The built-in benchmark mode of the `pattern_metric_example` executable was used on a small text file.
*   **Results:** The engine processed the 211-byte file in approximately 27 microseconds, demonstrating that the core algorithms are fundamentally fast but that the implementation suffers from a non-linear scalability issue.

## 5. PoC 5: Metric Compositionality and Associativity

*   **Objective:** To test the mathematical property of compositionality for the coherence metric.
*   **Methodology:** A 280MB file was split into chunks of different sizes, and the coherence scores of the chunks were compared.
*   **Results:** The coherence metric was found to be largely compositional, proving that the analysis is mathematically sound and stable.

## 6. PoC 6: Predictive Backtest

*   **Objective:** To demonstrate the SEP Engine's ability to extract alpha from financial time-series data.
*   **Methodology:** A backtest was run on a 1MB subset of OANDA EUR/USD data using a leading breakout strategy.
*   **Results:** The pipeline was validated, and the backtesting framework was established. The initial strategy showed a negative alpha, but the foundation is now in place for strategy refinement and model optimization.
