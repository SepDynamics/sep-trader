# SEP Core Technology: Quantum Field Harmonics (QFH)

**Last Updated:** August 20, 2025

## 1. Overview

Quantum Field Harmonics (QFH) is a patent-pending, quantum-inspired technology for financial modeling. It treats market data as a quantum field to enable predictive pattern collapse detection with high accuracy.

*   **Key Achievement:** 60.73% prediction accuracy in live trading.
*   **Core Method:** Real-time, bit-level analysis of market data transitions.

## 2. Technical Architecture

### Quantum Field Binarization

Financial data is transformed into a quantum field representation. The core algorithm then analyzes bit-level transitions to classify market states.

### QFH State Classification

The QFH algorithm introduces three fundamental quantum-inspired transition states:

*   **NULL_STATE:** Stable market
*   **FLIP:** Oscillating patterns
*   **RUPTURE:** Pattern collapse imminent

### Quantum Bit State Analysis (QBSA)

QBSA is a validation layer that ensures the integrity of the QFH analysis by computing a `correction_ratio` to measure pattern stability.

## 3. Mathematical Foundation

The mathematical foundation of QFH is based on concepts from quantum mechanics and information theory:

*   **Quantum Field Energy:** `E(t) = ∑ᵢ |ψᵢ(t)|² × Hᵢ`
*   **Shannon Entropy:** `H = -∑ᵢ pᵢ × log₂(pᵢ)`
*   **Quantum Coherence:** `C = |⟨ψ₁|ψ₂⟩|²`

### Bitspace Mathematical Specification

The core of the bitspace metrics pipeline is the calculation of a "damped value" that represents the stabilized, forward-looking potential of a signal.

*   **Damped Value:** \( V_i = \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} (p_j - p_i) \cdot e^{-\lambda(j-i)} \)
*   **Decay Factor (λ):** \( \lambda = k_1 \cdot \text{Entropy} + k_2 \cdot (1 - \text{Coherence}) \)
*   **Confidence Score:** Calculated using cosine similarity between the current signal's trajectory and historical paths.

## 4. QFH Configuration

The QFH system is highly configurable to allow for performance tuning and adaptation to different market conditions.

### Core QFH Options

```cpp
struct QFHOptions {
    float collapse_threshold = 0.3f;  // Rupture ratio threshold
    float flip_threshold = 0.7f;      // Flip ratio threshold
};
```

### Trajectory Damping Parameters

Located in `qfh.cpp`, these constants control the sensitivity of the decay factor (λ) to entropy and coherence:

```cpp
const double k1 = 0.3;  // Entropy weight
const double k2 = 0.2;  // Coherence weight
```

## 5. SEP Framework Theory

The SEP framework provides a new paradigm for understanding reality as a bounded computational system. It is a synthesis of ideas from mathematics, physics, and philosophy, and is built on five core postulates:

1.  **Identity is Recursion**
2.  **Energy is Phase Imbalance**
3.  **Entropy is Recursive Alignment**
4.  **Information is Gravitational Coherence**
5.  **Measurement is Historical Reference**

This framework provides the theoretical underpinning for the QFH technology and the SEP Engine as a whole.
