# CUDA Verification Test

This document outlines the process used to verify the CUDA build and runtime configuration for the SEP Engine.

## Summary

The `cuda_verify_test` executable was created to provide a standalone test for the CUDA compilation and linking process. This test performs the following steps:

1.  Initializes the CUDA device, allowing for the selection of a specific GPU.
2.  Creates a sample set of tick data on the host (CPU).
3.  Calls the `calculateForwardWindowsCuda` function to execute a CUDA kernel.
4.  Verifies that the CUDA kernel executed successfully and that the results are correctly returned to the host.

## Verification Steps

The following steps were taken to verify the CUDA configuration:

1.  **Build the Test Executable**: The `cuda_verify_test` executable was built using the main `build.sh` script, which ensures that the test is compiled with the same settings as the main application.

2.  **Test on NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070**: The test was run on the GTX 1070 (Compute Capability 6.1) and passed, confirming that the CUDA build is compatible with this architecture.

3.  **Test on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti**: The test was run on the RTX 3080 Ti (Compute Capability 8.6) by specifying device ID 1, and it also passed. This confirms that the build is correctly configured for multi-GPU environments and supports multiple CUDA architectures.

## Quantum Signal Bridge Integration Test

The `quantum_signal_bridge_test` executable provides an integration test for the `QuantumSignalBridge` class, which is the core component responsible for generating trading signals from market data. This test verifies the following:

1.  **Initialization**: The `QuantumSignalBridge` can be successfully initialized.
2.  **Signal Generation**: The bridge can process a sample of historical market data and forward window results to generate a trading signal.
3.  **End-to-End Verification**: The test confirms that the entire pipeline, from data input to signal generation, is functioning correctly.

This test is a critical part of the CI/CD pipeline and is run automatically to ensure that changes to the codebase do not break the signal generation logic.

## Future Testing

This verification test can be extended to include more comprehensive checks of the CUDA kernels and data structures. As new CUDA features are added, this test should be updated to ensure continued compatibility and correctness.

### Re-creating the Verification Tests

The verification tests were removed to keep the codebase clean. To re-create them, you will need to do the following:

1.  **Create the test files**: Re-create `cuda_verify_test.cpp` and `cuda_rolling_window_test.cpp` in `src/apps/oanda_trader`.
2.  **Update `CMakeLists.txt`**: Add the executables back to `src/apps/oanda_trader/CMakeLists.txt`.
3.  **Build the tests**: Run `./build.sh` to build the new test executables.
4.  **Run the tests**: Execute the tests from the `build/src/apps/oanda_trader` directory.
