# Proof-of-Concept Documentation

This directory contains a series of proof-of-concept (PoC) documents that track the evolution of the SEP Engine and its application to financial modeling. Each document represents a snapshot of the project at a particular stage, detailing the goals, methods, and results of that phase.

The PoCs are organized chronologically and demonstrate the progression from foundational concepts to the development of a predictive financial gauge. They serve as a detailed record of the project's journey and provide valuable context for the current state of the SEP Engine.
