# Proof of Concept 4: Baseline Performance Benchmark

**Date:** 2025-07-18

## 1. Objective

This document establishes a baseline performance metric for the core SEP Engine, as requested. The goal is to quantify the processing speed of the `PatternMetricEngine` on a small, controlled dataset. This provides a reference point for identifying and diagnosing performance bottlenecks when processing larger, more complex files.

## 2. Methodology

The built-in benchmark mode of the `pattern_metric_example` executable was used. The benchmark measures the performance of the `processFile` function, which includes file I/O, data ingestion, pattern evolution, and metric computation.

The benchmark was run on the `assets/test_data/benchmark_data.txt` file, which is a 211-byte text file.

The following command was executed:

```bash
/sep/build/examples/pattern_metric_example --benchmark --benchmark_filter=BM_ProcessFile
```

## 3. System Specifications

The benchmark was run on a system with the following specifications:

*   **CPU:** 18 Cores @ 3.2 GHz
*   **L1 Data Cache:** 48 KiB (x9)
*   **L1 Instruction Cache:** 32 KiB (x9)
*   **L2 Unified Cache:** 1280 KiB (x9)
*   **L3 Unified Cache:** 30720 KiB (x1)

*Note: The benchmark was run on a DEBUG build, which may be slower than a release build. ASLR was enabled, which can introduce minor noise.*

## 4. Results

The Google Benchmark output is reproduced below:

```
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BM_ProcessFile/"assets/test_data/benchmark_data.txt"      27183 ns        27120 ns        24366
```

## 5. Analysis

The key takeaways from this benchmark are:

1.  **Core Engine is Extremely Fast on Small Data:** The engine processed the 211-byte file in approximately **27 microseconds** (27,120 nanoseconds of CPU time). This is exceptionally fast and confirms that the fundamental operations of the engine are highly optimized for small inputs.

2.  **Calculated Processing Speed:** Based on this result, the theoretical processing speed is approximately **7.8 MB/s** (211 bytes / 27.12 Âµs).

3.  **Performance Paradox:** This high speed on small data creates a paradox when compared to the observed "stalling" on large files (e.g., the 14MB chunks from the 280MB file). If the performance were linear, a 14MB file should take less than 2 seconds to process. The fact that it takes much longer (or hangs) indicates that the engine's performance is **not linear** with input size.

## 6. Conclusion

The core algorithms of the `PatternMetricEngine` are fundamentally fast. However, the current implementation suffers from a severe algorithmic scalability issue. The performance degrades super-linearly, and likely polynomially or exponentially, as the number of internal patterns grows.

This proves that the bottleneck is not I/O or hardware limitations, but rather the internal data structures and algorithms within the C++ engine itself, specifically related to how it stores and processes the history of patterns.

**Next Steps:**
*   Investigate the source code of `PatternMetricEngine::evolvePatterns` and `PatternMetricEngine::computeMetrics` to identify the source of the non-linear complexity.
*   Refactor the engine to use more scalable data structures and algorithms for pattern storage and analysis.
