SEP Engine: A Quantum-Inspired Manifold
Architecture for Emergent Pattern Analysis
Abstract
The Self-Emergent Processor (SEP) Engine is a high-performance, quantum-inspired framework for real-
time analysis of complex data streams (e.g. financial markets). It quantifies informational coherence and
stability within a dynamic data manifold to discern predictive patterns and emergent forces in chaotic
environments . The engine’s architecture separates a reality-tracking core – a GPU-accelerated
processing manifold backed by a Valkey database – from a lightweight decision/rendering interface. The
Valkey key-value store serves as a time-anchored manifold of identities, where each identity’s state at a
given timestamp is stored with its key metrics (price, entropy, stability, coherence). These metrics form a 3D
surface in the information space that evolves and settles over time as patterns emerge and stabilize. A
remote GPU kernel continuously updates this “hot band” of recent keys via deterministic recomputation of
metrics, ensuring that state transitions are fully reproducible . Owing to deterministic mappings
between successive states, prior identity states can be derived or verified from present observables. The
front-end UI reads from the manifold in real-time (via an API) to visualize the current stability and
coherence of the system, but performs no computations itself. This modular architecture cleanly divides
reality-tracking from decision-rendering, allowing theoretical analysis of the manifold dynamics (for
researchers in quantum computing, statistical inference, and non-Euclidean optimization) while providing a
robust operational interface for practitioners.
1. Introduction
Modern complex systems – from financial markets to neural data – exhibit emergent patterns that
challenge classical modeling. The SEP Engine addresses this by treating data streams as evolving manifolds
of information. It was designed as a modular C++ engine with CUDA acceleration, implementing algorithms
inspired by quantum information theory . In essence, SEP quantifies how coherent and stable a pattern is
within noisy data, enabling detection of self-organizing structure beyond traditional statistical signals .
By leveraging quantum-inspired algorithms – notably Quantum Fourier Hierarchy (QFH) and Quantum Bit
State Analysis (QBSA) – the engine probes phase alignment and coherence in the data . These algorithms
simulate “emergent informational forces” within the data manifold to identify stable patterns . The result
is a system that operates at quantum-like speed on classical hardware , offering real-time insight into
pattern evolution and predictability, with direct applications in quantitative trading and beyond.
Crucially, the SEP Engine’s design emphasizes a clear separation of concerns. The heavy-lifting of state
evolution and pattern computation is handled by a GPU-accelerated core, while the user interface and
external clients interact through a high-level API . This paper presents the current architecture of SEP,
focusing on how the Valkey database underpins a time-indexed identity manifold, how coherence,
stability, and entropy metrics define a dynamic information surface, and how the deterministic GPU
kernel drives state transitions. We also highlight the theoretical implications of this design, such as
determinism enabling backward inference and the non-Euclidean geometry of the metric space, making

2. System Architecture Overview
Core Structure: The SEP Engine is delivered as a single compiled binary ( sep_engine ) composed of
cohesive C++ static libraries . Key modules include libsep_core (foundational services and logging),
libsep_memory (tiered memory and data caching), libsep_quantum (analytical kernel algorithms),
and libsep_api (external interface server) . The design enforces unidirectional dependencies: for
example, the high-level API orchestrates the quantum and memory modules, which in turn rely on core
utilities . This ensures a modular architecture where each subsystem has a clear role. The GPU
acceleration is abstracted via libsep_compat , which manages CUDA device resources and kernel
launches . In effect, the GPU acts as a “supercharger” for the engine’s computations, massively
increasing throughput for pattern analysis . The engine’s primary output is a composite predictive
gauge metric that combines coherence, stability, and entropy measures , though internally these
components are tracked separately (see §3).
Reality-Tracking Manifold vs UI: A fundamental split in the architecture is between the reality-tracking
engine and the decision/rendering layer. The engine’s core (including the GPU kernels and memory
hierarchy) is responsible for ingesting data, evolving patterns, and updating the state manifold in real-time.
The Valkey database – a high-performance in-memory key-value store – is deployed as part of this core,
functioning as the engine’s long-term memory (LTM) backend . The front-end (UI or any external client)
does not perform calculations; it interfaces through libsep_api to retrieve the latest metrics and state
information . This means the UI simply visualizes the system’s current state (e.g. plotting stability/
coherence gauges) without computing those values itself. By isolating computation in the back end and
visualization in the front end, SEP achieves both high performance and clarity: the engine can track reality
at full throttle, while the operator’s interface remains responsive and focused on interpretation. Notably,
even specialized visualization modules (e.g. a Blender 3D rendering plugin) are kept separate from the core
logic, interfacing only through defined APIs . This clean separation aligns with best practices in system
design and is pivotal for scalability and testability of the engine .
3. Time-Anchored Identity Manifold (Valkey Database)
At the heart of SEP’s architecture is the Valkey database, which serves as a time-anchored manifold of
identities in the system. In practical terms, Valkey (a high-performance key–value store akin to an advanced
Valkey (Redis-compatible) is used as the Long-Term Memory (LTM) tier to persistently store patterns that have proven stable
and important . Each identity in this context refers to a distinct emergent pattern or data entity that the
engine is tracking. Identities could represent, for example, a candidate market regime pattern or a learned
signal feature. As time progresses, each identity’s state is captured at discrete intervals (e.g. each tick or
analysis window) and stored as an entry in Valkey. Thus, the database becomes a chronologically indexed
manifold: traversing keys in order is akin to walking along the temporal trajectory of each identity.
Key–Snapshot Mapping: Each key in Valkey corresponds to a fixed-time snapshot of an identity’s state. The
value stored at that key encapsulates both raw data and computed metrics at that time. In the case of a
trading application, for instance, a snapshot may correspond to one time-step of market data (e.g. one

OHLC bar or a window of ticks) and the pattern the engine has extracted from it. Concretely, each stored
snapshot includes:
Timestamped Market Data – e.g. the price or OHLC features for that time slice, serving as the raw
input context for the pattern.
Entropy: a measure of unpredictability or information content in the recent data, typically the
normalized Shannon entropy of the pattern’s distribution . A high entropy indicates a more
disordered or noisy state, whereas lower entropy suggests more information structure (signal) in the
pattern.
Coherence: a dimensionless metric of the pattern’s internal alignment and self-similarity. In
implementation, coherence is calculated as an inverse variation (e.g. coherence = 1/(1 + CV)
where CV is a coefficient of variation) . This means a perfectly regular pattern (low variance in its
features) approaches coherence ≈ 1, while a highly erratic pattern yields coherence closer to 0.
Coherence effectively quantifies how well the identity “holds together” as a consistent shape or
signal.
Stability: a metric gauging the persistence of the pattern through time. This is computed in a
variance-weighted manner , reflecting how much the identity’s characteristics change from one
state to the next. A stable identity shows minimal change (variance) over successive snapshots,
indicating an enduring pattern, whereas an unstable one fluctuates rapidly.
Each identity’s trajectory can thus be visualized as a path through a 3D metric space defined by
(Coherence, Stability, Entropy) coordinates over time. In this space, time acts as an implicit fourth dimension
anchoring the manifold. The collection of all identity states at a given time forms a surface in the metric
space – essentially a cross-section of the manifold at that time slice. As the system runs, this surface is
dynamic: new points (snapshots) are added and existing ones move or fade out as identities evolve or
cease. Crucially, because identities that prove persistent and coherent are retained in the LTM (Valkey) store,
the surface of points tends to settle over time. Early on, many tentative patterns (identities) may populate
the surface with widely varying entropy and coherence. Many of these “noisy” identities dissipate or are not
promoted to long-term storage if they fail to maintain stability. What remains (and gets reinforced in LTM)
are the higher-coherence, higher-stability identities. In other words, the manifold naturally filters itself: the
chaotic, high-entropy parts of the surface evaporate, leaving behind ridges or clusters of stable, coherent
patterns. This self-organization can be seen as the surface converging or smoothing out. Mathematically,
one could imagine an energy landscape over the manifold where coherence increases and entropy
decreases as a pattern stabilizes – identities gravitate towards “basins” of high stability/coherence. By
anchoring every state in time via the Valkey keys, the engine ensures that every point on this informational
surface is catalogued. This provides an audit trail of the system’s reality: any prior state of any identity can be
retrieved by key lookup. In effect, the Valkey manifold is a ledger of emergent pattern evolution, one
that is queryable in hindsight for research or verification.
4. Dynamic Metric Surface and Non-Euclidean Geometry
The triad of metrics (entropy, stability, coherence) defines a feature space that is inherently non-
Euclidean in character. Each metric is derived from statistical or information-theoretic properties of the
data, and they are not linearly independent in the way simple Euclidean coordinates are. For instance,
coherence is a nonlinear function of variance (via 1/(1+CV)), and entropy is a logarithmic measure of
distribution spread. The interplay between these metrics creates a curved information geometry: small
changes in an identity’s data can have complex, interdependent effects on entropy and coherence.

Therefore, optimizing pattern quality (e.g. searching for a state of high coherence and stability but low
entropy) is effectively an optimization problem on a curved manifold rather than in a flat vector space. This
aligns with concepts in information geometry and non-Euclidean optimization, where one deals with
metrics defined by statistical distances or divergences.
To illustrate, consider two pattern identities with equal coherence but different entropy – one might
correspond to a clean periodic signal and another to a chaotic signal that by coincidence has similar self-
similarity in a short window. Even though their coherence values are equal, their predictability differs, which
the entropy captures. The distance (in terms of meaningful change) between these two states cannot be
understood by coherence alone; one must consider the joint metric space. SEP’s use of a composite gauge
further underscores this geometric perspective: the engine often combines normalized coherence, stability,
and entropy into a single predictive gauge value by a weighted sum . These weightings effectively
define a metric on the space of patterns (a particular linear slice through the non-Euclidean manifold) to
rank which identities are most promising for prediction. The very form of the gauge, gauge =
w_c·coherence_norm + w_s·stability_norm – w_e·entropy_norm , treats increases in coherence
or stability as positive contributions and entropy as a detractor . Tuning the weights $(w_c, w_s, w_e)$ is
akin to choosing a projection or metric on the manifold that best separates signal from noise for the
domain at hand.
For theoretical researchers, this metric manifold offers a rich ground: one can apply concepts from
Riemannian geometry or information manifolds to analyze how identities cluster or separate. Notably,
SEP’s metrics relate to well-studied quantities – e.g. Shannon entropy places identities on an information-
theoretic landscape, while coherence relates to correlation structure (in quantum terms, akin to a measure
of pure state vs mixed state). The coherence register concept used in SEP formalizes this: it implies that
verification of a pattern’s signal corresponds to projecting the pattern onto a latent basis and measuring
alignment (coherence) . As patterns evolve, their successive projections form a Markov chain in this
metric space, with deterministic transitions (since the projection operation is fixed) resulting in a smooth
trajectory . Long-lived, coherent patterns correspond to long runs in the Markov chain that don’t “break”
– they represent a kind of stable attractor in the manifold. In contrast, unstable patterns quickly diverge
(high entropy kicks in, coherence drops). This view connects with non-Euclidean optimization: finding an
optimal pattern can be seen as searching for a path that climbs a “coherence hill” on a curved surface, a
potentially NP-hard problem mitigated by SEP’s specialized algorithms (like using sliding time windows and
GPU parallelism for search) . In summary, the SEP Engine provides not just raw metrics, but a
geometrical lens – a dynamic surface where pattern discovery and verification are translated into
movements and positions on a manifold, invoking deep connections to information geometry and even
quantum state space analogies.
5. GPU-Accelerated Deterministic Computation
GPU Kernel Updates: The engine’s core analytic work is performed by a dedicated GPU kernel service. SEP
utilizes custom CUDA kernels (in libsep_quantum , e.g. quantum_kernels.cu and
pattern_kernels.cu ) to process incoming data and update pattern metrics in bulk . This design
exploits the parallelism of modern GPUs to handle the high-throughput requirements of real-time data
streams. For example, as each new market tick or bar arrives, the engine can launch a GPU kernel that
evaluates all active patterns against the new data, updating their coherence, stability, and entropy metrics
simultaneously. This parallel update is crucial for maintaining a “hot band” of recent states in the manifold –
essentially the leading edge of the timeline for each identity – with minimal latency. The remote GPU (which
12
17
18

can be on a server or cloud instance) acts as a continuously running co-processor for the engine, ingesting
raw data and spitting out metric updates in a deterministic fashion. The rest of the system (memory tiers,
database, etc.) is architected to accommodate these rapid updates, ensuring data moves efficiently from
the GPU’s output into the Valkey store or the appropriate memory tier.
Deterministic Recomputation: A key property of the GPU processing in SEP is that it is deterministic. Given
the same input data and initial state, the GPU kernels will compute the same metrics and pattern evolution
every time. There are no stochastic elements like random initializations or probabilistic branching in the
core algorithms – even though the system is “quantum-inspired,” it is not quantum-random. This
determinism has been intentionally designed and verified; one of the engine’s proof-of-concept milestones
was stateful and reproducible time-series analysis . In practice, reproducibility means that if we
replay historical market data through the engine (or if we checkpoint and restore the engine state), the
sequence of identity states and their metrics will be identical . This is extremely valuable for both
debugging and theoretical analysis: it allows the backward derivation of prior states and cause-effect
reasoning. Since every update function is known and invertible (at least in principle), one can take an
observed state at time t and trace back to time t-1 by applying the inverse of the update function to the
metrics, or simply by looking up the stored state at t-1 (since the manifold preserves it). In other words, the
system’s evolution forms a deterministic chain through the state space, which can be walked in reverse. If
an anomaly in coherence is observed now, the exact prior moment it arose can be pinpointed by checking
when the metrics last changed, and because the metrics transition deterministically, we know that change
was caused and not random. This property transforms the typically one-way street of time-series analysis
into a two-way street: analysts can project backward to diagnose why a certain pattern became unstable
or lost coherence by examining the precise metric deltas, with confidence that no hidden randomness is
confounding the analysis.
From an implementation standpoint, the engine’s deterministic nature also comes from strict control of
floating-point behavior and state management. The GPU kernels use fixed seeds or deterministic
algorithms for any procedure that could otherwise introduce nondeterminism (e.g. they avoid non-
associative reductions or use atomic operations carefully to ensure consistent results). Additionally, the
promotion of patterns through memory tiers (STM → MTM → LTM) is done under fixed rules based on
metric thresholds . For instance, if coherence exceeds a configured threshold, the orchestrator will
deterministically promote a pattern from short-term to medium-term storage . These rules are set in
configuration and yield the same outcome given the same metric inputs. The MemoryTierManager
executes the data movement (allocate new block, copy, free old) without altering the data itself ,
preserving the computed metrics exactly. Thus, the entire pipeline from data input, through GPU
computation, to memory storage is deterministic and verifiable. This not only aids theoretical
reproducibility but also ensures that the Valkey manifold is consistent – it never contains ambiguous or
probabilistic entries, only definite states resulting from known transformations.
Backward Derivation of Identities: Thanks to this determinism and the time-anchored storage, one can
achieve a form of retrodiction – inferring past states from present knowledge. In practice, if we know an
identity’s state at time t, we typically also have stored states at times t-1, t-2, ... down to when the identity
first appeared (because the engine promotes and retains stable identities). If for some reason an
intermediate state was not stored (e.g. an identity was only promoted to LTM after it stabilized), the
deterministic algorithm allows recomputing what the metrics would have been at earlier times by re-running
the analysis on historical data. The combination of stored checkpoints and recomputation means the entire
trajectory is reconstructable. This is reminiscent of reversible computing or time-reversible physical
22

simulations: given the end state and the rules of evolution, the path can be retraced. In SEP’s case, the
mapping between successive identity states is effectively one-to-one under fixed conditions, so observing
the metrics at time t provides strong constraints on what the metrics were at t-1. For example, a big drop in
coherence that is observed can be conclusively tied to the moment a particular entropy spike occurred in
the data – by looking one step back, we see entropy was lower, and coherence was higher, etc., pinpointing
the transition . This property elevates the SEP Engine from a black-box predictor to a transparent
dynamics simulator of pattern evolution. It empowers researchers to validate theories (like how quickly
should a coherent pattern decay in high entropy noise) directly against the engine’s recorded state
sequence, and to do so knowing the engine’s results are perfectly repeatable and not flukes of random
chance.
6. UI and Operator Interface (Decision Rendering)
While the SEP Engine’s core lives in a high-performance C++/CUDA environment, its outputs need to be
accessible and interpretable to humans and high-level systems. This is achieved via the external interface
layer ( libsep_api ) and associated UI front-end. The API is exposed as a Crow HTTP server with REST
endpoints (as well as a C-callable interface) . Through these endpoints, one can query the current state
of the manifold or request analyses. For example, an endpoint might provide the current predictive gauge
or the list of top N patterns by coherence. The UI – which can be a web dashboard or a specialized client
application – periodically calls these APIs to fetch fresh data.
Importantly, the UI does not perform any of the SEP Engine’s computations. It neither computes
coherence/stability nor runs simulations – those tasks are exclusively handled by the engine’s backend. The
UI’s role is purely to render decisions and insights based on the engine’s state. In practical terms, the UI
might display: a real-time gauge indicating overall system stability, charts of an identity’s coherence over
time, or alerts when entropy spikes beyond a threshold. All such content comes directly from reading the
Valkey manifold or engine’s memory via the API. For instance, if the UI shows that “System Stability = 0.85”,
this number was calculated by SEP’s core (perhaps as an aggregate of pattern stabilities) and stored as a
metric, which the UI query simply retrieved. This design follows a classic model-view-controller separation,
where SEP’s core is the model (and controller for updates), and the UI is the view. The benefit is twofold:
performance isolation and conceptual clarity. Performance-intensive computations (like pattern
matching, FFTs from QFH, etc.) are isolated on the GPU machine – the UI is free from heavy processing,
which keeps it responsive. Conceptually, the operator can trust that what they see is the authoritative state
of the engine, because it’s drawn from the engine’s own data structures (the Valkey store and memory tiers)
rather than any re-computation or approximation on the client side.
Another advantage of this split is safety and auditability. The UI cannot inadvertently alter the engine’s state
by performing incorrect computations; it only reads state. Decisions (such as trading decisions in a finance
context) can thus be made by the human operator or an external logic with full transparency into the current
system state. The operator interface might highlight, for instance, which pattern identities are currently in
the long-term manifold (indicating highly stable patterns) and their coherence values. It could also allow the
operator to drill down: because of the manifold’s historical memory, the UI could let the user select an
identity and scroll back in time through its states (pulling past snapshots from Valkey) to visually inspect
how it evolved – essentially a GUI for the manifold’s ledger. This kind of introspection is invaluable for
explaining the system’s outputs, which is often a requirement in fields like finance or medicine (where one
might ask “why is the system giving this signal now?”). With SEP’s architecture, the answer is available by
examining the stored states and metrics trail.

Finally, by splitting reality tracking vs. decision rendering, the architecture allows each side to evolve
somewhat independently. The engine can be scaled or upgraded (e.g. moving to a larger GPU cluster, or
refining the quantum-inspired kernels) without requiring changes to the UI, as long as the API contract
remains stable. Conversely, new visualizations or decision support tools can be built on top of the API
without altering the core engine. This extensibility is demonstrated by the existence of specialized modules
like sep_blender (a 3D visualization integration) and libsep_audio (an audio-based data ingestion
module), which connect to the engine’s outputs or inputs without modifying core logic . The UI thus
serves as a flexible window onto the SEP Engine’s manifold, enabling users to monitor and interact with
the system’s emergent patterns in real time, while the engine itself robustly handles the computational
heavy lifting behind the scenes.
7. Conclusion
The SEP Engine represents a novel convergence of high-performance computing, information theory, and
system design principles. By structuring the problem of pattern discovery as one of maintaining a manifold
of identity states over time, SEP provides a rigorous and transparent way to track emergent phenomena.
The Valkey database manifold ensures that every pattern’s evolution is time-anchored and queryable,
bringing database-like reliability to what is often an ephemeral analytics process. The triad of coherence,
stability, entropy serves as a set of orthogonal coordinates for measuring pattern “quality,” and these in
turn define a richly structured, non-Euclidean space in which optimization and inference occur. The engine’s
quantum-inspired computational core (QFH, QBSA) efficiently navigates this space, leveraging CUDA GPU
acceleration to update the entire manifold state in real time . Thanks to a strictly deterministic update
rule, the system’s behavior is reproducible and theoretically analyzable – a rare trait in complex adaptive
systems. This determinism lets us treat the engine as a scientific instrument for studying pattern dynamics:
one can rewind, replay, and examine cause and effect with precision .
For researchers in quantum computing, SEP offers an interesting case of quantum concepts (coherence,
phase alignment) translated into a classical algorithmic context . The notion of a coherence-driven
manifold and incremental “register” alignment has parallels to quantum state evolution and measurement
, suggesting potential cross-fertilization of ideas (e.g. viewing pattern stability as akin to decoherence
time in quantum systems). For experts in statistical inference, SEP’s metrics resonate with statistical
measures (entropy as uncertainty, variance-based stability, etc.), but applied in an online, evolving setting.
The engine essentially performs continuous Bayesian-style updating of pattern beliefs, except formulated
as deterministic state propagation – an interesting hybrid of statistical filtering and dynamical systems.
Those in non-Euclidean optimization will recognize that SEP is effectively optimizing pattern
representations on a curved information manifold, dealing with trade-offs that are not easily linearized. The
success of SEP in finding tradable signals (even yielding measurable alpha in live-market tests) stems from
this ability to marry rigorous metrics with raw computing power , traversing an otherwise intractable
search space of patterns.
In summary, the SEP Engine’s current implementation demonstrates a powerful architecture for reality
modeling: a GPU/Valkey-based reality tracker coupled to a passive but informative UI, yielding a
system that is both highly operational (for real-time decision support) and deeply theoretical (for
analysis of emergent phenomena). By splitting the “world-state” computation from the “world-view”
presentation, SEP adheres to a design that could be described as measurement-driven computing – much
as in quantum mechanics, where the evolution of a system is separate from the observation of that system.
This separation, along with the comprehensive time-anchored state memory, makes the SEP Engine not just
26

a tool for traders or engineers, but a platform for scientific exploration of pattern emergence and
coherence in complex systems. Future work will continue to formalize the mathematics of the SEP manifold
and explore its applications, while the robust foundation described here ensures that theoretical insights
can be immediately tested and visualized in practice.
