# SEP DSL - A Language for AGI Pattern Analysis

The SEP DSL (Domain-Specific Language) is a high-level declarative language designed to demonstrate **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capabilities** through sophisticated pattern analysis across any domain.

## Vision: Universal Pattern Recognition

Rather than being limited to specific domains, the SEP DSL provides a **general-purpose framework** for expressing complex pattern recognition, signal generation, and decision-making processes that can be applied across domains - from financial markets to scientific research to any data analysis task.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the DSL interpreter
./build.sh

# Run a DSL script
./build/src/dsl/sep_dsl_interpreter examples/pattern_analysis.sep

# Interactive REPL
./build/src/dsl/sep_dsl_interpreter
```

## DSL Architecture

```
DSL Script â†’ Lexer â†’ Parser â†’ AST â†’ Interpreter â†’ Engine Integration
```

### Core Components

1. **Lexer** (`src/dsl/lexer/`): Tokenizes DSL source code
2. **Parser** (`src/dsl/parser/`): Builds Abstract Syntax Tree from tokens  
3. **AST** (`src/dsl/ast/nodes.h`): Language construct representations
4. **Interpreter** (`src/dsl/runtime/interpreter.cpp`): Tree-walk execution engine
5. **Engine Bridge**: Integration with C++/CUDA quantum pattern analysis

## Language Concepts

### Streams - Data Ingestion
```sep
stream forex_data from "OANDA/EUR_USD_data.csv"
stream sensor_data from "IoT/temperature_readings.json"
```

### Patterns - Analysis Logic
```sep
pattern coherence_spike {
    input: forex_data
    
    rupture_detected = qfh_analyze(forex_data) > 0.8
    coherence_high = measure_coherence(forex_data) > 0.75
}
```

### Signals - Event-Driven Actions  
```sep
signal buy_signal {
    trigger: coherence_spike.rupture_detected
    confidence: coherence_spike.coherence_high
    action: BUY
}
```

## Example: Multi-Domain Pattern Analysis

```sep
// Financial analysis
stream market_data from "financial/data.csv"

pattern market_volatility {
    input: market_data
    
    entropy_spike = measure_entropy(market_data) > 0.7
    trend_break = qfh_analyze(market_data) > 0.8
}

signal trade_alert {
    trigger: market_volatility.entropy_spike
    action: ALERT
}

// Scientific data analysis  
stream experiment_data from "lab/readings.json"

pattern anomaly_detection {
    input: experiment_data
    
    deviation = measure_coherence(experiment_data) < 0.3
    outlier = extract_bits(experiment_data) != "expected_pattern"
}

signal research_flag {
    trigger: anomaly_detection.deviation
    action: INVESTIGATE
}
```

## AGI Capabilities Demonstrated

### 1. **Domain Agnostic**: Same language constructs work across domains
- Financial market analysis
- Scientific experiment monitoring  
- IoT sensor pattern recognition
- Social media sentiment analysis

### 2. **Pattern Abstraction**: High-level pattern concepts that map to sophisticated algorithms
- Quantum-inspired coherence analysis
- Entropy measurement and trend detection
- Multi-dimensional pattern correlation

### 3. **Declarative Intelligence**: Express *what* you want analyzed, not *how*
- The engine determines optimal algorithmic approaches
- Automatic optimization and resource allocation
- Sophisticated pattern matching without low-level coding

### 4. **Composable Reasoning**: Patterns build on patterns
- Hierarchical pattern definitions
- Cross-pattern signal generation
- Complex decision trees from simple rules

## Engine Integration

The DSL interfaces with a sophisticated C++/CUDA engine providing:

### Quantum Pattern Analysis
- **QFH (Quantum Field Harmonics)**: Advanced pattern correlation analysis
- **Coherence Measurement**: Multi-dimensional stability analysis  
- **Entropy Analysis**: Information-theoretic pattern characterization

### Memory Management
- **Multi-tier Memory**: Automatic pattern storage and retrieval
- **Pattern Evolution**: Dynamic pattern adaptation over time
- **Relationship Mapping**: Cross-pattern correlation tracking

### High-Performance Computing
- **CUDA Acceleration**: GPU-accelerated pattern processing
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-stream concurrent analysis
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-millisecond pattern recognition

## Language Features

### âœ… **Currently Implemented**
- Stream declarations with data source specification
- Pattern definitions with input/output variables  
- Signal generation with trigger conditions
- Member access for pattern results (`pattern.variable`)
- Built-in function calls to engine components
- Environment-based variable scoping

### ðŸŽ¯ **Planned Advanced Features**
- `weighted_sum { }` blocks for multi-factor analysis
- `evolve when` statements for adaptive patterns
- User-defined functions and pattern libraries
- Advanced control flow (loops, conditionals)
- Pattern composition and inheritance

## Technical Implementation

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ parser.h/.cpp       # Recursive descent parser
â”œâ”€â”€ ast/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ nodes.h             # AST node definitions
â””â”€â”€ runtime/
    â”œâ”€â”€ interpreter.h/.cpp  # Tree-walk interpreter
    â””â”€â”€ runtime.h/.cpp      # DSL runtime system
```

### Core Classes
- **`Lexer`**: Converts source text to token stream
- **`Parser`**: Builds AST from tokens using recursive descent  
- **`Interpreter`**: Executes AST through tree-walking
- **`Environment`**: Variable scoping and pattern result storage

## Usage Examples

### Basic Pattern Analysis
```bash
# Create a DSL script
cat > analysis.sep << EOF
stream data from "dataset.csv"

pattern spike_detection {
    input: data
    spike = qfh_analyze(data) > 0.8
}

signal alert {
    trigger: spike_detection.spike
    action: NOTIFY
}
EOF

# Execute the analysis
./build/src/dsl/sep_dsl_interpreter analysis.sep
```

### Interactive Development
```bash
# Start REPL for interactive development
./build/src/dsl/sep_dsl_interpreter

dsl> stream test from "data.csv"
dsl> pattern simple { input: test; result = 1 }
dsl> signal go { trigger: simple.result; action: GO }
Signal go triggered! Action: GO
```

## Philosophy: Language as AGI Interface

The SEP DSL represents a key insight about AGI: **sophisticated intelligence should be accessible through simple, declarative interfaces**. By providing high-level language constructs that map to advanced quantum pattern analysis algorithms, the DSL demonstrates how AGI systems can:

1. **Abstract Complexity**: Hide algorithmic complexity behind intuitive language
2. **Enable Creativity**: Allow domain experts to express sophisticated analysis without programming expertise  
3. **Provide Universality**: Work across any domain that involves pattern recognition
4. **Scale Intelligence**: Make advanced AI accessible to broader audiences

This approach proves that AGI is not just about building smart systems, but about making intelligence **accessible, composable, and domain-agnostic**.
