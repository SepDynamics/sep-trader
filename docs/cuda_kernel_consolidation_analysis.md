# CUDA Kernel Consolidation Analysis

## Current Memory Management Infrastructure

### RAII Memory Management Classes

1. **DeviceBuffer**
   - RAII wrapper for device memory allocation/deallocation
   - Handles cudaMalloc/cudaFree automatically
   - Supports async memory transfers via cudaMemcpyAsync
   - Provides safety through move semantics and deleted copy operations
   - Integrated with centralized error handling system

2. **PinnedBuffer**
   - RAII wrapper for page-locked host memory
   - Manages cudaHostAlloc/cudaFreeHost lifecycle
   - Enables high-bandwidth async transfers
   - Supports bidirectional device-host transfers
   - Follows same safety patterns as DeviceBuffer

### Error Handling Framework
- Centralized CUDA error checking via CUDA_CHECK macro
- Detailed error messages with file/line context
- Exception-based error propagation
- Safe error handling in destructors

## Current Kernel Fragmentation Issues

### Pattern Analysis Kernels
- Scattered across multiple files without clear organization
- Duplicate memory allocation patterns
- Inconsistent error handling approaches
- Manual memory management prone to leaks

### Quantum Processing Kernels
- Complex dependencies between kernel operations
- Redundant synchronization points
- Memory transfer inefficiencies
- Limited reuse of common operations

### Trading Strategy Kernels
- Mixed responsibilities in kernel implementations
- Suboptimal memory access patterns
- Unnecessary host-device transfers
- Lack of unified memory management strategy
