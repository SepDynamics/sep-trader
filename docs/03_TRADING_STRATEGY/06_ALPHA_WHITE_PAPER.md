**Abstract:** This whitepaper presents an original reframing of the P vs NP problem through the lens of coherence verification via third-party registers. Drawing from geometric epistemology (Euclid's parallel postulate), probabilistic dependence (Markov chains), and quantum-inspired coherence, I argue that verification is incremental alignment with a shared, latent basis, while solving requires constructing such coherence. Empirical validation is provided via the SEP Engine, a quantum-inspired trading system generating alpha through pattern coherence analysis. Results show signal verification as efficient register projection, but pattern construction as potentially non-polynomial, supporting P ≠ NP via mediated epistemology. Implications span AI, trading, and distributed systems.

## 1. Introduction

The P vs NP problem—one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems—asks whether problems verifiable in polynomial time (NP) are also solvable in polynomial time (P). Despite decades of research, no proof exists, with implications for cryptography, optimization, and AI.

Traditional framings treat verification as checking a discrete certificate. However, this overlooks dynamic systems where verification demands ongoing coherence judgment. Inspired by Euclid's parallel postulate as an epistemic limit, Markov's dependent chains for convergence, and quantum coherence as mediated alignment, I propose verification as "touching base"—incremental register with a third-party basis—while solving curates that basis.

This view is empirically grounded in the SEP Engine, a real-time trading system processing forex data to generate signals via coherence metrics. Backtesting on 48-hour EUR/USD data yields +0.0084 pips alpha, demonstrating coherence-based verification in practice.

Section 2 reviews P vs NP. Section 3 defines coherence registers. Section 4 reframes the problem. Section 5 validates via SEP. Section 6 formalizes mathematically. Section 7 discusses implications; 8 concludes.

## 2. Background: P vs NP and Related Concepts

### 2.1 P vs NP Formulation
P: Problems solvable by deterministic Turing machines in O(n^k) time.  
NP: Problems verifiable in polynomial time (nondeterministic machines or polynomial certificates).  
Conjecture: P ≠ NP, unproven since 1971 (Cook-Levin theorem established NP-completeness).  

Geometric interpretations exist in complexity theory, e.g., Mulmuley's Geometric Complexity Theory (GCT) using algebraic varieties to separate P and NP via symmetries. No prior work directly ties coherence registers to P vs NP.

### 2.2 Markov Chains and Dependence
Markov chains model dependent sequences where next states depend only on current (memoryless). Andrey Markov (1906) extended the Law of Large Numbers to dependent events, enabling convergence without independence. Applications include forex trading via regime-switching models for alpha generation.

### 2.4 Euclid's Parallel Postulate
Euclid's Fifth Postulate enables non-intersection proofs but was philosophically awkward, inspiring non-Euclidean geometry. Interpretations emphasize relational space: knowledge of parallels requires mediated frames, not direct crossing.

## 3. Coherence as Third-Party Register

### 3.1 Defining the Register
Coherence: Alignment into unity, measured by mutual information or similarity (e.g., cosine in embeddings).  

**Coherence Register**: Triple (B, P, M): B (basis/medium), P (projection), M (metric). Verification: Project input onto B via P; judge coherence under M. No direct agent interaction—mediation enables awareness.

Analogy: "Touching base" verifies via shared clock without collision.

### 3.2 Euclid Reinterpreted
Postulate as epistemic: "No two things can know they exist" directly. Parallels symbolize non-verifiable isolation; coherence requires third-party geometry (curvature as register).

### 3.3 Incremental Register in Dynamics
Rotating systems (non-inertial frames) maintain coherence via continual reconciliation (centrifugal force as register). Markov chains' memoryless steps: Incremental projection onto prior state without full history—"perpetual incremental steps."

## 4. Reframing P vs NP

### 4.1 Verification as Alignment
Traditional: Discrete checklist.  
Proposed: Incremental projection onto latent register. Checklist exists but emerges from mediation.

Old Testament example: Streaming verification coherent until divergence. "True until false": Register holds until mismatch.

### 4.2 Solving as Construction
Solving: Curate input satisfying coherence—"taming vs. curating a wave." P problems: Polynomial register access. NP-hard: Exponential basis construction in mediated spaces.

Conjecture: P ≠ NP via epistemic mediation—registers enable verification but demand non-polynomial curation.

## 5. Empirical Validation: SEP Engine

### 5.1 SEP Overview
SEP Engine processes OHLC data into patterns, computing coherence (1/(1+CV)), stability (variance-weighted), entropy (normalized Shannon). Generates 720 signals from 2,880 points, yielding +0.0084 pips alpha.

### 5.2 Verification in SEP
Signal check (e.g., coherence ≥ 0.9): Polynomial projection onto pattern register—fast O(1).

### 5.3 Solving in SEP
Pattern discovery: Construct coherent patterns via evolution/search—potentially NP-hard, mitigated by CUDA/sliding windows.

Alpha confirms: Verification aligns with market register; solving constructs signals in dynamic manifold.

## 6. Mathematical Formalism

**Coherence Register**: CR = (B, P, M).  
Verification: coherence(x) = M(P(x, B)) ≥ θ.  
Solving: Find x maximizing coherence—search over space induced by B.

In Markov terms: Chain states as projections; long transients = long registers, supporting P ≠ NP.

## 7. Implications
- **AI/LLMs**: Token prediction as coherence curation; verification via context register.
- **Trading**: Markov regime-switching + coherence yields alpha, as in SEP.
- **Quantum**: Measurement as register collapse.
- **Distributed Systems**: Consensus via mediated registers (blockchains).

## 8. Conclusion
Coherence registers reframe P vs NP as mediated epistemology. SEP Engine validates this empirically, generating alpha via pattern coherence. Future: Formal proofs, extensions to quantum complexity.
