# Data Processing Pipeline

This document describes the end-to-end data processing pipeline of the SEP Professional Trader-Bot, from raw data ingestion to enterprise-level storage and management.

## 1. High-Level Overview

The system is capable of processing both real-time and historical market data. It is designed to be data-agnostic, but is optimized for financial time-series data.

- **Real-Time Data:** Connects to live data streams (e.g., OANDA) for real-time analysis.
- **Historical Data:** Processes historical data for backtesting, model training, and analysis.
- **Multi-Timeframe Synchronization:** Can synchronize data from multiple timeframes (e.g., M1, M5, M15).

## 2. Bitspace Metrics Pipeline

The core of the signal processing logic involves treating market data as a complex signal in a bitspace representation.

1.  **Bitstream Conversion:** Raw market data (e.g., candlestick data) is converted into a bitstream using `MarketDataConverter`.
2.  **CUDA Kernel Processing:** The bitstream is processed in parallel on the GPU using QBSA (Quantum Bit State Analysis) and QFH (Quantum Field Harmonics) kernels.
3.  **Future Trajectory Integration:** The kernels integrate a forward window of future data points to calculate how the initial signal evolves over time.
4.  **Damping and Stabilization:** Metrics like coherence, stability, and entropy are repeatedly calculated until they converge to a stable "damped" value.
5.  **Confidence Scoring:** The trajectory of the metrics during the damping process is compared against a database of historical paths to generate a confidence score.

## 3. Enterprise Data Layer

The system uses a robust, enterprise-grade data layer for high performance, scalability, and reliability.

### 3.1. Core Components

- **`RemoteDataManager`:** Orchestrates all data operations, including market data, training data, and model synchronization between local and remote environments.
- **`TrainingCoordinator`:** Manages distributed model training across multiple nodes.

### 3.2. Database Technologies

- **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB:** The primary database for time-series market data. TimescaleDB provides automatic partitioning, compression, and fast queries for financial data.
- **Redis:** A high-speed, in-memory cache for frequently accessed data, such as real-time prices and trading signals, ensuring sub-millisecond retrieval.

### 3.3. Database Schema Example

```sql
-- Market data hypertable (TimescaleDB)
CREATE TABLE market_data (
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    pair VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,
    open DECIMAL(10,5),
    high DECIMAL(10,5),
    low DECIMAL(10,5),
    close DECIMAL(10,5),
    volume BIGINT
);
SELECT create_hypertable('market_data', 'timestamp');

-- Storage for quantum patterns
CREATE TABLE quantum_patterns (
    pattern_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    pair VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,
    pattern_data BYTEA,
    confidence_score DECIMAL(5,3)
);

-- Tracking for trading results
CREATE TABLE trading_results (
    trade_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    pair VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,
    direction VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
    entry_price DECIMAL(10,5),
    exit_price DECIMAL(10,5),
    profit_loss DECIMAL(10,2),
    pattern_id UUID REFERENCES quantum_patterns(pattern_id)
);
```

### 3.4. Performance Optimization

- **HWLOC Integration:** The system uses HWLOC to enable NUMA-aware processing. This optimizes performance by binding threads to specific CPU cores for better memory access patterns, especially on multi-socket servers.
- **Database Indexing:** Concurrent indexes and materialized views are used to accelerate queries without locking the database.

## 4. Multi-Asset Pipeline

The architecture is designed to be expanded from single-instrument processing to a scalable, multi-asset pipeline.

### 4.1. Supported Assets
- **Forex:** EUR/USD, GBP/USD, USD/JPY, AUD/USD
- **Futures (Planned):** Commodities and equity futures.

### 4.2. Pipeline Design
An asynchronous queue aggregates price updates from multiple instruments concurrently. Each stream is produced by an independent coroutine and processed by a single consumer task, ensuring thread-safe handling of events.

A generic `MarketEvent` structure will be used to normalize fields such as timestamp, price, and volume so that analysis modules can remain asset-agnostic.

## 5. Security

- **Encrypted Connections:** All connections to PostgreSQL and Redis are encrypted.
- **API Key Management:** Secure management for external service credentials.
- **Access Control:** Role-based access control and separate credentials for training and trading operations.
- **Audit Logging:** All data access and modifications are logged for auditing purposes.
