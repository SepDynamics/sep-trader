# Patent Portfolio Overview

This document provides an overview of the patent portfolio for the SEP Professional Trader-Bot.

## Invention Disclosures

- **Quantum Field Harmonics (QFH) Algorithm:** Interprets bit transitions as quantum states to flag NULL_STATE, FLIP, or RUPTURE conditions for early pattern collapse detection.  
  *See: [QFH Invention Disclosure](../05_PATENT_PORTFOLIO/01_QFH_INVENTION_DISCLOSURE.md)*

- **Quantum Bit State Analysis (QBSA) Algorithm:** Compares probe indices to expectations, computing correction ratios and predicting collapse when thresholds are exceeded.  
  *See: [QBSA Invention Disclosure](../05_PATENT_PORTFOLIO/02_QBSA_INVENTION_DISCLOSURE.md)*

- **Quantum Manifold Optimizer:** Maps financial patterns onto Riemannian manifolds and samples tangent spaces for multi-objective optimization.  
  *See: [Quantum Manifold Optimizer Invention Disclosure](../05_PATENT_PORTFOLIO/03_QUANTUM_MANIFOLD_OPTIMIZER_INVENTION_DISCLOSURE.md)*

- **Pattern Evolution System:** Treats patterns as evolving quantum entities with heritable coherence, stability, entropy and relationship data.  
  *See: [Pattern Evolution Invention Disclosure](../05_PATENT_PORTFOLIO/04_PATTERN_EVOLUTION_INVENTION_DISCLOSURE.md)*

## Prosecution Timeline

- **July 27, 2025:** Invention disclosures recorded for QFH, QBSA, Quantum Manifold Optimizer, and Pattern Evolution systems.
- **August 3, 2025:** Patent application filed; application #584961162ABX covers all four innovations.
- **Present:** Application pending with ongoing prosecution monitoring and response management.

## Trade Secret Summary

- QFH damping relies on empirically tuned coefficients (k1, k2), which remain confidential.  
  *Reference: `src/core/qfh.cpp`*

- QBSAâ€™s collapse thresholds and correction ratios are calibrated with proprietary datasets.  
  *Reference: `src/core/qbsa.cpp`*

- Historical path repositories driving pattern coherence and stability metrics are maintained as internal assets.  
  *Reference: `src/core/pattern_processor.cpp`*

## Implementation Highlights

- `qfh.cpp` classifies adjacent bits and streams real-time state transitions, implementing the QFH disclosure.
- `qbsa.cpp` analyzes probe indices and detects collapse via adaptive thresholds, embodying the QBSA claims.
- `pattern_processor.cpp` derives coherence, stability, and entropy metrics from damped trajectories, aligning with the Pattern Evolution framework.
