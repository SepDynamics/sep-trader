# Technical Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the SEP Professional Trader-Bot's architecture and core technologies. 

## Core Philosophy

The system is built on a patent-pending technology called **Quantum Field Harmonics (QFH)**. This approach uses principles from quantum mechanics to analyze financial market data at a bit-level, identifying subtle patterns and predicting market movements with high accuracy.

The architecture is designed to be a **hybrid system**:
- **Local Machine (CUDA):** Handles the computationally intensive model training, leveraging GPU acceleration.
- **Remote Droplet (CPU):** Executes the lightweight trading logic based on the models generated locally.

This separation ensures both high performance for model training and cost-effective, reliable trade execution.

## Key Technology Components

Here is a summary of the main components of the system. For more detailed information, please refer to the documents in the respective folders.

### 1. Quantum Field Harmonics (QFH) Engine
- **Description:** The core of the trading bot, responsible for analyzing market data and generating trading signals.
- **Location:** `src/core/` and `src/cuda/`
- **Further Reading:** [QFH Technology](./../02_CORE_TECHNOLOGY/00_QFH_TECHNOLOGY.md)

### 2. System Architecture
- **Description:** A hybrid local/remote design that separates model training from trade execution.
- **Location:** `src/app/`
- **Further Reading:** [System Architecture](./../01_ARCHITECTURE/00_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)

### 3. Data Processing Pipeline
- **Description:** A robust pipeline for ingesting, processing, and storing market data.
- **Location:** `src/io/` and `src/util/`
- **Further Reading:** [Data Pipeline](./../01_ARCHITECTURE/01_DATA_PIPELINE.md)

### 4. Professional State Management
- **Description:** A system for managing the state of the trading bot, including configuration, trading pairs, and performance metrics.
- **Location:** `src/core/trading_state_manager.cpp`

## Performance

The system has been designed for high performance and scalability. Key performance metrics include:
- **60.73%** high-confidence prediction accuracy
- **<1ms** CUDA processing time for signal generation
- **24/7** autonomous operation
