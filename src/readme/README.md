# Source Directory Overview

The `src` folder hosts the project's primary code modules:

- **app** – Application services, command-line interfaces, and trading logic orchestrators.
- **core** – Engine components for pattern analysis, training, and system coordination.
- **cuda** – GPU kernels and CUDA utilities for accelerated computation.
- **io** – Connectors for market data, external APIs, and C interface bindings.
- **util** – Shared utilities, helpers, and infrastructure support.
- **common** – Minimal shared headers and scaffolding.

Several submodules contain stubbed or placeholder implementations pending full development.
