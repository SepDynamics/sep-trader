# Experiment 004: Signal Generation Analysis

## Key Discovery
**Both phases generate nearly all signals**: 
- Phase 1: 1440 patterns → 1439 signals (99.9%)
- Phase 2: 1440 patterns → 1439 signals (99.9%)

## Backtesting Results Comparison
- **Phase 1**: 50.94% accuracy (733/1439 correct)
- **Phase 2**: 39.05% accuracy (562/1439 correct)

## Root Cause Found
The issue is NOT signal generation selectivity but **pattern quality differences** that lead to different prediction accuracy:

1. **Pattern Processing**: Phase 2's market regime analysis in pattern creation affects pattern quality
2. **Signal Quality**: Both generate similar signal counts, but Phase 2's signals are lower quality
3. **Accuracy Impact**: Phase 2's enhanced pattern processing actually hurts prediction accuracy

## Analysis
Phase 2's "enhancements" (market regime analysis, signal quality calculations) are **degrading pattern quality** rather than improving it. The market regime adjustments in pattern creation are corrupting the base patterns that made Phase 1 successful.

## Next Steps
1. **Remove market regime from pattern creation** entirely in Phase 2
2. **Test pure Phase 1 pattern logic** in Phase 2 framework
3. **Focus on pattern quality** rather than signal filtering
