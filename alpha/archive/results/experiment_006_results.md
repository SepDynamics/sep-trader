# Experiment 006 Results: Confidence-Based Filtering

## Configuration Tested
- Confidence threshold: ≥ 0.6
- Coherence threshold: ≥ 0.9  
- Stability threshold: ≥ 0.0
- Based on alpha analysis documentation

## Results
- **Overall Accuracy**: 38.99% (unchanged)
- **Total Predictions**: 1,439
- **High Confidence Signals**: 0 ❌

## Critical Finding
**NO HIGH CONFIDENCE SIGNALS FOUND**: The alpha analysis thresholds are too restrictive for our current signal generation. None of the 1,439 signals meet the criteria (confidence ≥ 0.6, coherence ≥ 0.9, stability ≥ 0.0).

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Coherence threshold too high**: 0.9 may be unrealistic for forex data
2. **Confidence scaling issue**: Our confidence values may be scaled differently than expected
3. **Pattern quality issue**: Our patterns may not be reaching the quality levels assumed in the alpha analysis

## Next Steps - Experiment 007
**Threshold Calibration**: Test progressive threshold levels to find realistic values:
- Test coherence: 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9
- Test confidence: 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8
- Find optimal balance between signal count and accuracy

## Hypothesis
The alpha analysis was likely done on different data or with different scaling. Need to calibrate thresholds to our actual signal distribution.
