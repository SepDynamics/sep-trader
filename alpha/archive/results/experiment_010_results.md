# Experiment 010 Results: Ultra-High Selectivity

## Configuration Tested
- **Confidence**: ≥0.7 (maximum quality selection)
- **Coherence**: ≥0.6 (high quality patterns only)  
- **Stability**: ≥0.0 (baseline)

## Results
- **Overall Accuracy**: 38.99% (unchanged)
- **High Confidence Accuracy**: 46.00% 
- **High Confidence Signals**: 50 (3.5%)

## Filtering Performance Analysis

| Experiment | Confidence | Coherence | HC Accuracy | HC Signals | Signal % | Improvement |
|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Baseline | N/A | N/A | 38.99% | 1439 | 100% | - |
| 007 | ≥0.5 | ≥0.6 | 42.33% | 215 | 14.9% | +3.34 pts |
| 008 | ≥0.6 | ≥0.5 | 43.87% | 212 | 14.7% | +4.88 pts |
| 009 | ≥0.65 | ≥0.55 | 46.15% | 117 | 8.1% | +7.16 pts |
| **010** | **≥0.7** | **≥0.6** | **46.00%** | **50** | **3.5%** | **+7.01 pts** |

## Key Finding: Diminishing Returns Threshold
**Peak Performance Reached**: 46.15% at 8.1% selectivity appears to be the optimal balance. Ultra-high selectivity (3.5%) shows slight decrease to 46.00%.

## Strategic Insight
**Filtering Plateau**: Quality-based filtering alone has reached its ceiling around 46% accuracy. Further improvements require:

1. **Pattern Enhancement**: Phase 1 optimization strategy approaches
2. **Multi-timeframe Analysis**: Coherence across temporal scales  
3. **Additional Pattern Types**: Expand beyond current 5 validated types

## Next Phase: Pattern Enhancement
Time to implement Phase 1 enhancements from the Performance Optimization Strategy:
- Multi-timeframe analysis (M1, M5, M15, H1)
- Additional pattern types (TrendAcceleration, MeanReversion, etc.)
- Expected: +8-12% accuracy improvement to reach 54-58%
