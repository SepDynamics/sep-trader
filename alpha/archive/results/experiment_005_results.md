# Experiment 005 Results: Pure Phase 1 Pattern Logic

## Configuration Tested
- Market regime analysis: COMPLETELY REMOVED from pattern creation
- Pattern processing: Pure Phase 1 stability calculation with volatility factor
- Signal generation: Exact Phase 1 logic with volume factors
- Backtesting: Simplified without market state dependencies

## Results
- **Overall Accuracy**: 38.99% ‚ùå (Target: 50.94%)
- **Total Predictions**: 1,439 (vs Phase 1's ~76)
- **Correct Predictions**: 561

## Critical Discovery
**FILTERING MECHANISM MISSING**: Even with pure Phase 1 pattern logic, Phase 2 still generates 1439 signals vs Phase 1's ~76. This confirms the core issue is NOT in pattern creation but in **signal filtering selectivity**.

## Root Cause Analysis
Phase 1 must have a hidden filtering mechanism that we haven't identified:

1. **Different threshold application**
2. **Additional signal validation**  
3. **Stricter confidence requirements**
4. **Volume or time-based filtering**

## Next Investigation
Need to compare Phase 1 vs Phase 2 **actual signal generation logic** line by line to find the missing filter that reduces 1439 potential signals to ~76 actual signals.

## Hypothesis for Experiment 006
**Debug Signal Generation**: Add detailed logging to both phases to identify exactly where Phase 1 filters out 95% of signals while Phase 2 doesn't.
