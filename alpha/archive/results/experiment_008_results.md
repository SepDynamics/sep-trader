# Experiment 008 Results: Threshold Optimization

## Configuration Tested
- **Confidence**: ≥0.6 (above average 0.566)
- **Coherence**: ≥0.5 (above average 0.460)
- **Stability**: ≥0.0 (baseline)

## Results
- **Overall Accuracy**: 38.99% (unchanged)
- **High Confidence Accuracy**: 43.87% ✅ (+4.88 points vs baseline)
- **High Confidence Signals**: 212 (14.7%)

## Improvement Tracking
| Experiment | Confidence | Coherence | HC Accuracy | HC Signals | Improvement |
|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 007 | ≥0.5 | ≥0.6 | 42.33% | 215 (14.9%) | +3.34 pts |
| 008 | ≥0.6 | ≥0.5 | 43.87% | 212 (14.7%) | +4.88 pts |

## Success Validation
**Continued improvement**: +1.54 percentage points from experiment 007, proving threshold optimization is working systematically.

## Next Test - Experiment 009
Test higher selectivity: **confidence≥0.65, coherence≥0.55**
- Target: >45% accuracy with 8-12% signal selection
- Balance between quality and quantity
