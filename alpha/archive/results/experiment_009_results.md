# Experiment 009 Results: High Selectivity Achievement

## Configuration Tested  
- **Confidence**: ≥0.65 (well above average 0.566)
- **Coherence**: ≥0.55 (well above average 0.460)
- **Stability**: ≥0.0 (baseline)

## Results
- **Overall Accuracy**: 38.99% (unchanged)
- **High Confidence Accuracy**: 46.15% ✅ **TARGET ACHIEVED!**
- **High Confidence Signals**: 117 (8.1%)

## Improvement Summary
| Experiment | Confidence | Coherence | HC Accuracy | HC Signals | Improvement |
|------------|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Baseline | N/A | N/A | 38.99% | 1439 (100%) | - |
| 007 | ≥0.5 | ≥0.6 | 42.33% | 215 (14.9%) | +3.34 pts |
| 008 | ≥0.6 | ≥0.5 | 43.87% | 212 (14.7%) | +4.88 pts |
| **009** | **≥0.65** | **≥0.55** | **46.15%** | **117 (8.1%)** | **+7.16 pts** |

## Major Success
**46.15% accuracy achieved** - representing a **+7.16 percentage point improvement** over baseline with highly selective filtering (8.1% of signals).

## Performance Analysis
- **Quality over Quantity**: By filtering to top 8.1% of signals, achieved significant accuracy boost
- **Selectivity Works**: Higher thresholds continue to improve performance
- **Approaching Phase 1**: 46.15% vs Phase 1's 50.94% (gap narrowed to 4.79 points)

## Next Steps
1. **Test even higher selectivity** (confidence≥0.7) to see if 50%+ is achievable
2. **Compare with Phase 1** filtering approach
3. **Implement Phase 1 enhancements** from optimization strategy for further gains
