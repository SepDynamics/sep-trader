# Experiment 010: Ultra-High Selectivity for 50%+ Target

## Hypothesis
With current signal distribution (confidence avg=0.566, max=1.106), testing ultra-high selectivity (confidence≥0.7) may achieve 50%+ accuracy to match Phase 1's 50.94% baseline.

## Strategy
**Maximum Quality Selection**: Focus on top ~5% of signals with highest confidence and coherence
- **Confidence**: ≥0.7 (well above average, approaching max)  
- **Coherence**: ≥0.6 (above average for quality)
- **Stability**: ≥0.0 (baseline)

## Expected Outcome
- **Target**: 50%+ accuracy (matching/exceeding Phase 1)
- **Signal Selection**: 3-6% of total (50-90 signals)
- **Quality Focus**: Only highest confidence predictions

## Success Criteria
- High confidence accuracy >50%
- Minimal signal count but maximum quality
- Validate filtering approach before pattern enhancements
