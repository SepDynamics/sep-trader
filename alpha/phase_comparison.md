# Phase 1 vs Phase 2 Performance Analysis

## Performance Summary

| Metric | Phase 1 | Phase 2 (Current) |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| Accuracy | 50.94% | 40.91% |
| Total Predictions | ~76 | 176 |
| Signal Quality | Balanced | 19.9% high quality |

## Key Differences

### Phase 1 Strengths
- **Volatility Adaptation**: Dynamic threshold adjustment based on market volatility
- **Balanced Weights**: stability=0.4, coherence=0.4, entropy=0.2
- **Proven Thresholds**: buy=0.50, sell=0.52 with slight asymmetry
- **Simplicity**: Direct scoring without complex adjustments

### Phase 2 Additions
- **Market Regime Detection**: Classifies market states (trending, ranging, volatile)
- **Signal Quality Filtering**: Attempts to filter low-quality signals
- **Enhanced Output**: More detailed metrics and regime information

### Regression Root Causes

1. **Quality Filter Mismatch**: 
   - Phase 2's quality threshold (0.45-0.6) may be filtering out profitable signals
   - High quality doesn't necessarily correlate with profitability

2. **Regime Complexity**: 
   - Market regime adjustments introduced noise
   - Simple volatility adaptation (Phase 1) outperformed complex regime logic

3. **Parameter Drift**:
   - Phase 2 weights may not be optimally tuned
   - Threshold values diverged from Phase 1's proven settings

## Hypothesis for Improvement

**Test Phase 1 parameters in Phase 2 framework:**
- Use Phase 1's exact weights (0.4, 0.4, 0.2)
- Apply Phase 1's thresholds (0.50, 0.52)
- Keep volatility adaptation, remove regime multipliers
- Simplify quality filtering
