## Feature Description
A clear and concise description of the feature you'd like to see.

## Problem Statement
What problem would this feature solve? Is your feature request related to a problem?

## Proposed Solution
Describe the solution you'd like. How should this feature work?

### Language Syntax (if applicable)
If this is a language feature, show how you envision the syntax:

```sep
pattern example_usage {
    // Show how the new feature would be used
    new_feature_result = proposed_function(input_data)
    
    // Or new syntax
    if new_condition_type {
        // new behavior
    }
}
```

### API Design (if applicable)
If this affects the C API or language bindings:

```c
// C API
sep_error_t sep_new_function(sep_interpreter_t* interp, const char* param);
```

```ruby
# Ruby API
result = interpreter.new_method(data)
```

## Use Cases
Describe specific use cases where this feature would be valuable:

1. **Use Case 1**: Description and why current solutions are insufficient
2. **Use Case 2**: Another scenario where this would help
3. **Use Case 3**: Additional benefits

## Alternatives Considered
Describe alternative solutions or features you've considered:

- **Alternative 1**: Why this doesn't fully solve the problem
- **Alternative 2**: Trade-offs with this approach
- **Workarounds**: Current ways to achieve similar results

## Implementation Ideas
If you have ideas about how this could be implemented:

- **Core Language**: Changes needed to lexer/parser/interpreter
- **Engine Integration**: New AGI functions or optimizations required
- **Language Bindings**: Updates needed for Ruby/Python/etc.
- **Performance Considerations**: Expected impact on speed/memory

## Examples and Documentation
Show how this feature would be documented:

```sep
// Example 1: Basic usage
pattern basic_example {
    result = new_feature("input")
    print("Result:", result)
}

// Example 2: Advanced usage
pattern advanced_example {
    // More complex scenario
}
```

## Priority and Impact
- **Priority**: Low / Medium / High / Critical
- **Users Affected**: How many users would benefit?
- **Effort Estimate**: Rough idea of implementation complexity

## Additional Context
- Related issues or discussions
- Links to research papers or references
- Screenshots or mockups if applicable
- Real-world examples from other languages/tools

## Acceptance Criteria
What would make this feature complete?

- [ ] Core functionality implemented
- [ ] Tests added
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Examples provided
- [ ] Language bindings updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks (if applicable)

## Questions for Discussion
- Any concerns about backward compatibility?
- Should this be configurable or always-on?
- How does this interact with existing features?
