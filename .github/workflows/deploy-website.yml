        # Add .nojekyll file to disable Jekyll build
        # This is necessary because the website is built with Vite, not Jekyll
        # and the default Jekyll build process will fail.
        # The .nojekyll file tells GitHub Pages to just serve the static files.
        # See https://github.blog/2009-12-29-bypassing-jekyll-on-github-pages/
        # for more information.
        # The file is created automatically by the action when this option is set.
        # The action will also commit the file to the gh-pages branch.
        # This is the correct way to disable Jekyll for a subdirectory deployment.
        # The alternative is to create the file manually in the build step,
        # but this is cleaner and more reliable.
        # The action will also handle the CNAME file correctly.
        # The `cname` option is a shorthand for creating the CNAME file.
        # The `force_orphan` option ensures a clean deployment history.
        # The `user_name` and `user_email` options are required for the commit.
        # The `commit_message` is a custom message for the deployment commit.
        # The `publish_dir` is the directory containing the built website.
        # The `github_token` is required to push to the gh-pages branch.
        # The `if` condition ensures that the deployment only runs on pushes to main or master.
        # The `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` action is the recommended action for deploying to GitHub Pages.
        # It is well-maintained and has all the necessary features.
        # The version is pinned to v4 to ensure stability.
        # The action is configured to deploy to the `gh-pages` branch.
        # The `force_orphan` option creates a new commit history for each deployment,
        # which is useful for keeping the deployment branch clean.
        # The `cname` option creates a CNAME file with the specified domain name.
        # The `user_name` and `user_email` options are used for the commit author.
        # The `commit_message` is the message for the deployment commit.
        # The `.nojekyll` file is created by setting the `nojekyll` option to `true`.
