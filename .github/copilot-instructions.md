## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements a quantum-inspired trading platform with three core components:

## Quantum Field Harmonics (QFH) Engine
Importance Score: 95/100

Core implementation in src/core/qfh.cpp:
- Patent-pending quantum state transition analysis
- Real-time pattern collapse prediction through bit-level analysis
- Multi-timeframe coherence correlation using M1/M5/M15 data
- Trading signal generation with 60.73% accuracy rate

## Pattern Evolution System
Importance Score: 90/100

Located in src/core/pattern_evolution.cpp:
- Dynamic pattern adaptation using quantum metrics
- Three-tier memory system (STM/MTM/LTM) for pattern storage
- Coherence-based pattern promotion/demotion logic
- Pattern relationship tracking through quantum entanglement metrics

## Trading Signal Processor
Importance Score: 85/100

Implemented in src/core/trading_state_manager.cpp:
- Signal qualification using quantum coherence thresholds
- Multi-factor scoring combining stability and entropy
- Market regime adaptation through volatility analysis
- Pattern-Trajectory blending with weighted consensus

The system uses quantum-inspired algorithms to detect market patterns and generate trading signals. The QFH engine processes market data through quantum state transitions, while the pattern evolution system manages pattern lifecycles based on coherence metrics. Trading decisions are made through multi-timeframe consensus with quantum stability measures.
