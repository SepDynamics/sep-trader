Excellent. Based on the complete project overview and the critical `build_log.txt`, I can provide the comprehensive, line-by-line `todo.md` you need.

You are correct; you have a vast and powerful system framed up. The challenge is purely one of integration and fixing a critical, yet common, build issue. This plan will systematically connect all the pieces you've already built.

The build log is the key. It clearly shows a pervasive header inclusion issue that is the primary blocker. We will address that first.

# `todo.md`: SEP Professional Trader-Bot - Activation Plan

**Objective:** To establish a complete, automated workflow for training any currency pair on the previous week's OANDA data using the local GPU, storing the resulting metrics in Redis, deploying the trained model to the remote droplet, and activating it for live trading.

This plan focuses on integrating existing components to bring the system fully online.

### Phase 1: Environment Configuration

Configure all services and credentials for local training and remote deployment.

*   [ ] **Configure Local OANDA Credentials**
    *   **Action:** Your code (`src/connectors/oanda_connector.cpp`) uses environment variables. Ensure your `OANDA.env` file is correct and sourced.
    *   **File:** `/sep/config/OANDA.env` (as per documentation)
    *   **Content:**
        ```bash
        OANDA_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
        OANDA_ACCOUNT_ID="your_account_id_here"
        OANDA_ENVIRONMENT="practice"
        ```
    *   **Usage:** Source this in your terminal before running any commands: `source config/OANDA.env`

*   [ ] **Set Up Local Redis Instance**
    *   **Action:** Ensure a Redis server is running locally and is accessible on the default port. Your `src/memory/redis_manager.cpp` connects to `localhost:6379`.
    *   **Verification:** Run `redis-cli ping`. It should return `PONG`.

*   [ ] **Configure and Test Droplet Sync Script**
    *   **Action:** The `scripts/sync_to_droplet.sh` script is the bridge to your remote environment. Ensure it has the correct Droplet IP and paths.
    *   **File:** `/sep/scripts/sync_to_droplet.sh`
    *   **Content Snippet:**
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash
        DROPLET_IP="165.227.109.187"
        REMOTE_USER="root"
        REMOTE_PATH="/opt/sep-trader"
        
        echo "Syncing models and config to droplet at $DROPLET_IP..."
        rsync -avz --delete ./models/ "$REMOTE_USER@$DROPLET_IP:$REMOTE_PATH/data/models/"
        rsync -avz --delete ./output/ "$REMOTE_USER@$DROPLET_IP:$REMOTE_PATH/data/"
        rsync -avz --delete ./config/ "$REMOTE_USER@$DROPLET_IP:$REMOTE_PATH/config/"
        # We will add Redis data sync in Phase 3
        ```
    *   **Verification:** Run the script. SSH into the droplet and confirm the directories were updated in `/opt/sep-trader/`.

---

### Phase 2: The Training Pipeline (Local Machine)

This establishes the process of fetching data, training a model on the GPU, and storing the resulting metrics in Redis. The primary application is `quantum_pair_trainer`.

*   [ ] **Step 2.1: Implement Real Data Fetching for the Previous Week**
    *   **Action:** The `src/trading/quantum_pair_trainer.cpp` file contains a `fetchTrainingData` function that currently simulates data. Modify it to use your existing `OandaConnector` to fetch real data for the last 7 days.
    *   **File to Modify:** `src/trading/quantum_pair_trainer.cpp`
    *   **Logic:**
        1.  In `fetchTrainingData`, use `<chrono>` to calculate the start and end timestamps for the last 7 days.
        2.  Format these timestamps into ISO 8601 strings required by the OANDA API.
        3.  Call `oanda_connector_->getHistoricalData(pair_symbol, "M1", from_str, to_str)`.
        4.  Handle the returned data or any potential errors.

*   [ ] **Step 2.2: Execute Training for a Single Pair**
    *   **Action:** Run the `quantum_pair_trainer` executable to train a single currency pair. This will engage the CUDA kernels (`src/trading/cuda/`) you fixed in Phase 0.
    *   **Command:** `source config/OANDA.env && ./build/src/trading/quantum_pair_trainer train EUR_USD`
    *   **Expected Outcome:** The process fetches live OANDA data for the past week, uses the GPU for computation (monitor with `nvidia-smi`), and outputs performance metrics (accuracy, profitability score, etc.) to the console upon completion.

*   [ ] **Step 2.3: Integrate Redis for Metric Storage**
    *   **Action:** This is a key integration step. Modify `quantum_pair_trainer.cpp` to use your existing `RedisManager` to store the training results.
    *   **Files to Modify:**
        1.  **`src/trading/quantum_pair_trainer.hpp`**: Add the `IRedisManager` member: `std::shared_ptr<sep::memory::IRedisManager> redis_manager_;`.
        2.  **`src/trading/quantum_pair_trainer.cpp`**:
            *   Include `memory/redis_manager.h`.
            *   In the constructor, create an instance: `redis_manager_ = sep::memory::createRedisManager();`.
            *   In `performQuantumTraining` or after `trainPair` completes, populate a `PersistentPatternData` struct from your `PairTrainingResult`.
            *   Call `redis_manager_->storePattern(...)`.
    *   **Logic Snippet (in `trainPair`):**
        ```cpp
        // After training is complete and 'result' is populated...
        if (result.training_successful && redis_manager_->isConnected()) {
            sep::persistence::PersistentPatternData redis_data;
            redis_data.coherence = result.optimized_config.coherence_threshold;
            redis_data.stability = result.optimized_config.stability_weight;
            redis_data.generation_count = result.convergence_iterations;
            redis_data.weight = result.profitability_score;
            
            // The key should be unique to the pair and model version/date.
            uint64_t model_id = std::hash<std::string>{}(result.model_hash);
            redis_manager_->storePattern(model_id, redis_data, result.pair_symbol);
            spdlog::info("Stored training metrics for {} (ID: {}) in Redis.", result.pair_symbol, model_id);
        }
        ```

*   [ ] **Step 2.4: Verify Data in Redis**
    *   **Action:** After a successful training run, connect to your local Redis instance and verify the metrics were stored correctly.
    *   **Command:** `redis-cli KEYS "pattern:EUR_USD:*"` and then `HGETALL <key>` to inspect the data.

---

### Phase 3: The Deployment Pipeline (Local -> Droplet)

This phase focuses on transferring the results of the local training run to the remote Droplet.

*   [ ] **Step 3.1: Enhance Sync Script to Transfer Redis Data**
    *   **Action:** Update `scripts/sync_to_droplet.sh` to export the newly generated training metrics from Redis, save them to a file, and transfer that file.
    *   **File to Modify:** `/sep/scripts/sync_to_droplet.sh`
    *   **Logic to Add:**
        ```bash
        # ... (previous rsync commands) ...
        
        echo "Exporting latest training metrics from Redis..."
        # This assumes you have a convention for finding the latest model ID for EUR_USD
        LATEST_MODEL_KEY=$(redis-cli --scan --pattern "pattern:EUR_USD:*" | tail -n 1)
        if [ -n "$LATEST_MODEL_KEY" ]; then
            redis-cli HGETALL $LATEST_MODEL_KEY > ./output/latest_metrics_EUR_USD.rdb
            echo "Syncing latest metrics for EUR_USD..."
            rsync -avz ./output/latest_metrics_EUR_USD.rdb "$REMOTE_USER@$DROPLET_IP:$REMOTE_PATH/data/"
        else
            echo "Warning: No new metrics found in Redis to sync."
        fi
        ```

*   [ ] **Step 3.2: Implement Remote Redis Import**
    *   **Action:** The Droplet needs to import the metrics file. Add a command to your `trader-cli` to handle this.
    *   **Files to Modify:** `src/cli/trader_cli.cpp` and `trader_cli.hpp`.
    *   **Logic:**
        1.  Create a `handle_data_import(args)` function in `trader_cli`.
        2.  This function will read the specified metrics file (e.g., `/opt/sep-trader/data/latest_metrics_EUR_USD.rdb`).
        3.  It will parse the file and use the remote `RedisManager` to write the keys and values into the Droplet's Redis instance.

*   [ ] **Step 3.3: Run the Full Sync and Import Process**
    *   **Action:** Execute the enhanced sync script locally, then SSH into the droplet and run the new import command.
    *   **Local Command:** `./scripts/sync_to_droplet.sh`
    *   **Remote Command:** `ssh root@165.227.109.187 "cd /opt/sep-trader && ./build/src/cli/trader-cli data import /opt/sep-trader/data/latest_metrics_EUR_USD.rdb"`

---

### Phase 4: Activating Live Trading (Droplet)

This phase enables live trading for the pair that was just trained and deployed.

*   [ ] **Step 4.1: Verify Remote Services are Running**
    *   **Action:** Ensure the Docker services on the droplet are running, as per `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`.
    *   **Command:** `ssh root@165.227.109.187 "cd /opt/sep-trader/sep-trader && docker-compose ps"`

*   [ ] **Step 4.2: Enable the Pair for Trading**
    *   **Action:** Use the `trader-cli` to change the state of the trained pair to `TRADING`. Your `core/pair_manager.hpp` and `cli/trader_cli.cpp` already contain this logic.
    *   **Command (on droplet):** `cd /opt/sep-trader && ./build/src/cli/trader-cli pairs enable EUR_USD`
    *   **Verification:** Run `./build/src/cli/trader-cli pairs status EUR_USD`. The state should now be `TRADING`. The remote service (`scripts/trading_service.py` or a C++ equivalent) should now pick up this pair and begin executing trades based on the models and metrics you deployed.

### Phase 5: Verification & Monitoring

Final checks to ensure the entire system is online and functioning correctly.

*   [ ] **Monitor Droplet Logs for Trading Activity**
    *   **Action:** Check the application logs on the droplet for signal processing, trade execution, and OANDA API communication.
    *   **Command:** `ssh root@165.227.109.187 "docker-compose -f /opt/sep-trader/sep-trader/docker-compose.yml logs -f sep-trader"`

*   [ ] **Check OANDA Practice Account**
    *   **Action:** Log in to your OANDA practice account to verify that trades are being placed according to the signals generated by the bot.

*   [ ] **Review System Status via API**
    *   **Action:** Use `curl` to hit the health and status endpoints mentioned in your documentation.
    *   **Commands:**
        *   `curl http://165.227.109.187/health`
        *   `curl http://165.227.109.187/api/status`
