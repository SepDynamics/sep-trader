Okay, this is a fantastic amount of framed-up work. The comprehensive documentation and the current build logs provide a clear picture of the system's state. You're right, the core algorithms and components are largely "isolation tested" (meaning they work in a controlled environment), but the integration and the overarching build stability are the current hurdles.

The `build_log.txt` clearly points to a persistent issue with `std::array` not being found, originating from `src/engine/internal/standard_includes.h`. This means that even if you've applied this fix before, it's either been reverted, or the Docker build environment isn't consistently applying it, leading to the same compilation failures repeatedly. This is indeed the absolute highest priority.

Let's create a detailed, line-by-line `todo.md` that leverages all your existing work and systematically brings the entire SEP Trader Bot system online.

# `todo.md`: SEP Trader Bot Online Activation Roadmap

**System Architecture Overview:**
-   **Local Machine (CUDA-enabled):** The primary development and training environment. This machine is responsible for fetching OANDA data, running CUDA-accelerated quantum pattern analysis training, optimizing models, and pushing generated metrics to the remote droplet.
-   **Remote Droplet (CPU-only):** The production trading execution environment. This droplet receives trained models and metrics, runs the CPU-only trading logic, executes trades via the OANDA API, and logs real-time performance.

---

## PHASE 0: CRITICAL BUILD FIXES & LOCAL ENVIRONMENT VALIDATION

**Objective:** Ensure a completely clean compilation of all C++ executables on the local training machine and verify core local services/tools are functional. This phase *must* be 100% complete before proceeding.

-   [ ] **0.1: Re-apply `std::array` Header Fix within Dockerfile**
    *   **Problem:** The `std::array` errors persist, indicating the fix isn't durable in the Docker build. This suggests the fix needs to be baked into the Docker image creation process itself.
    *   **File:** `/sep/Dockerfile`
    *   **Action:** Locate the `RUN` command that installs dependencies or copies source. Ensure an explicit `echo '#include <array>' >> /path/to/src/engine/internal/standard_includes.h` (or a similar `sed` command) is run *before* the `cmake` and `make` steps, directly within the Dockerfile's `sep_build_env` stage. Alternatively, ensure `standard_includes.h` is modified *on the host* and properly copied into the Docker image *before* the build step.
    *   **Verification:** Run `docker build --target sep_build_env -t sep_build_env .`
    *   **Expected:** This Docker build stage should complete without `std::array` errors.

-   [ ] **0.2: Rebuild All Executables with Fixed Docker Environment**
    *   **Problem:** The `build_log.txt` shows multiple executables failing (e.g., `sep_dsl_interpreter`, `quantum_pair_trainer`).
    *   **Command:** `./build.sh` (from `/sep` directory)
    *   **Verification:** Confirm that *all* 6 primary executables listed below are successfully built. Check `output/build_log.txt` for `FAILED:` lines. If any persist, address them one by one.
        -   `./build/src/cli/trader-cli`
        -   `./build/src/apps/data_downloader`
        -   `./build/src/apps/oanda_trader/oanda_trader`
        -   `./build/src/apps/oanda_trader/quantum_tracker`
        -   `./build/src/dsl/sep_dsl_interpreter`
        -   `./build/src/trading/quantum_pair_trainer`
    *   **Troubleshooting:** If new errors appear, prioritize `nlohmann::json` and TBB-related issues, as they often stem from compiler/library mismatches.

-   [ ] **0.3: Configure Local Redis Connection**
    *   **Problem:** The system needs to connect to Redis for caching.
    *   **File:** `config/database.conf` (confirm its existence; if not, create based on `README.md` mentions).
    *   **Action:** Ensure `host: localhost`, `port: 6379` (or your local Redis settings). This configuration is used by `src/memory/redis_manager.cpp`.
    *   **Verification:** Run `redis-cli ping`. It should return `PONG`.

-   [ ] **0.4: Verify Local CLI Tools and Engine Status**
    *   **Action:** Set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to ensure CLI tools can find their dynamically linked dependencies.
    *   **Command (Local):** `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./build/src/core:./build/src/config:./build/src/c_api`
    *   **Command (Local):** `./build/src/cli/trader-cli status`
    *   **Verification:** The CLI should execute and report system status without errors.

-   [ ] **0.5: Run Core Test Suite Validation (Local Machine)**
    *   **Problem:** The `AGENT.md` lists 7 critical test suites that must pass.
    *   **Commands (Local):**
        ```bash
        ./build/tests/test_forward_window_metrics
        ./build/tests/trajectory_metrics_test
        ./build/tests/pattern_metrics_test
        ./build/tests/quantum_signal_bridge_test
        ./build/src/apps/oanda_trader/quantum_tracker --test
        ./build/examples/pme_testbed_phase2 Testing/OANDA/O-test-2.json
        # (For the last one, confirm output shows correct metrics, e.g., tail -15)
        # Also ensure DSL tests pass
        ./run_dsl_tests.sh
        ```
    *   **Verification:** All tests should report `PASSED`.

---

## PHASE 1: REMOTE DROPLET SETUP & CONNECTIVITY

**Objective:** Provision the Digital Ocean droplet, install necessary dependencies, and establish basic connectivity for data transfer.

-   [ ] **1.1: Run Automated Droplet Deployment**
    *   **Problem:** The droplet needs base OS, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, and SEP repo cloned.
    *   **File:** `scripts/deploy_to_droplet.sh`
    *   **Action (Local Machine):** `./scripts/deploy_to_droplet.sh`
    *   **Reference:** `DROPLET_SETUP.md` for expected output and steps within the script.
    *   **Verification:** SSH into droplet (`ssh root@165.227.109.187`) and confirm `docker-compose ps` shows services are up. Verify volume is mounted (`df -h`).

-   [ ] **1.2: Initialize PostgreSQL Database on Droplet**
    *   **Problem:** The trading bot requires a populated database schema.
    *   **File:** `scripts/init_database.sql`
    *   **Action (Droplet):** `cd /opt/sep-trader/sep-trader && sudo -u postgres psql sep_trading < scripts/init_database.sql`
    *   **Verification (Droplet):** `sudo -u postgres psql sep_trading -c "SELECT * FROM v_database_info;"` should return schema details.

-   [ ] **1.3: Configure OANDA Credentials on Droplet**
    *   **Problem:** The remote trading service needs OANDA API access.
    *   **File:** `/opt/sep-trader/config/OANDA.env`
    *   **Action (Droplet):** Edit this file with your OANDA `API_KEY`, `ACCOUNT_ID`, and set `OANDA_ENVIRONMENT=practice` (or `live`).
    *   **Verification:** No direct verification here, but subsequent trading will fail if incorrect.

-   [ ] **1.4: Configure Droplet's Local Services (Redis/PostgreSQL)**
    *   **Problem:** The CPU-only build needs to connect to *its own* local Redis/PostgreSQL.
    *   **File:** `/opt/sep-trader/config/database.conf`
    *   **Action (Droplet):** Ensure this file is configured for `localhost` connections for both Redis and PostgreSQL.
    *   **Verification (Droplet):** Set library path: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./build/src/core:./build/src/config:./build/src/c_api`. Then run: `./build/src/cli/trader-cli data status` and `./build/src/cli/trader-cli cache stats`. Both should show successful connections.

---

## PHASE 2: LOCAL TRAINING & METRICS GENERATION PIPELINE

**Objective:** Establish the full cycle of fetching OANDA data, training a pair using the local CUDA GPU, and saving the generated metrics. (All commands in this phase are run from your **local CUDA machine**).

-   [ ] **2.1: Configure Local OANDA Credentials**
    *   **Problem:** The local training system needs access to OANDA data.
    *   **File:** `OANDA.env` (in `/sep` root)
    *   **Action (Local):** Ensure this file contains your OANDA `API_KEY`, `ACCOUNT_ID`, and `OANDA_ENVIRONMENT=practice` (or `live`).
    *   **Verification:** No direct verification here, but data fetching will fail.

-   [ ] **2.2: Fetch OANDA Data for the Previous Week**
    *   **Problem:** Training requires recent historical data.
    *   **Component:** `src/apps/data_downloader.cpp` (orchestrated by `train_manager.py`)
    *   **Action (Local):** `source OANDA.env && python train_manager.py fetch-all`
    *   **Reference:** `QUICKSTART.md` (mentions `python train_manager.py status` which implies fetch). The `README.md` also mentions `python train_manager.py status`. The `data_downloader.cpp` itself is a simple app, `train_manager.py` is the orchestrator.
    *   **Verification:** Check `cache/oanda/` directory for newly downloaded JSON files (e.g., `EUR_USD_48h_cache.json`).

-   [ ] **2.3: Train a Currency Pair (e.g., EUR_USD) via GPU**
    *   **Problem:** Models need to be trained leveraging CUDA.
    *   **Components:** `src/trading/quantum_pair_trainer.cpp` (CUDA kernels in `src/trading/cuda/`) and orchestrated by `train_manager.py`.
    *   **Action (Local):** `source OANDA.env && python train_manager.py train EUR_USD`
    *   **Reference:** `QUICKSTART.md` mentions `python train_manager.py train EUR_USD`.
    *   **Verification:** The script output should show training progress and, upon completion, report performance metrics (e.g., `High-Confidence Accuracy` ~60%, `Profitability Score` >200) as seen in `PERFORMANCE_METRICS.md` and `AGENT.md`.

-   [ ] **2.4: Store & Export Metrics for Deployment**
    *   **Problem:** Trained model parameters and performance metrics need to be persisted for transfer.
    *   **Components:** `train_manager.py` (orchestrates saving to Redis) and potentially a direct file export.
    *   **Action (Local):** The `train_manager.py train` command should ideally handle this. Verify the output.
    *   **Verification:** Confirm that a new file (e.g., `output/metrics/EUR_USD_metrics.json`) is created containing the trained model's parameters and performance indicators. Also, verify entries in your local Redis for this pair (e.g., `redis-cli KEYS "model:EUR_USD:*" `).

---

## PHASE 3: DATA SYNCHRONIZATION & REMOTE TRADING ACTIVATION

**Objective:** Transfer trained models and configurations to the droplet and initiate the autonomous trading service. (All commands in this phase are run on the **remote trading droplet** unless specified).

-   [ ] **3.1: Synchronize Data to the Droplet**
    *   **Problem:** Trained models and configs need to be on the droplet.
    *   **File:** `scripts/sync_to_droplet.sh`
    *   **Action (Local Machine):** `./scripts/sync_to_droplet.sh`
    *   **Reference:** `CLOUD_DEPLOYMENT.md` and `TRAINING_AND_DEPLOYMENT.md` mention this.
    *   **Verification (Droplet):** SSH to droplet and check if the `output/` directory contains the transferred `metrics/` and other relevant files.

-   [ ] **3.2: Import Metrics into Droplet's Redis**
    *   **Problem:** The live trading service needs access to the newly trained model's metrics.
    *   **Component:** `trader-cli` (needs a `metrics import` command or similar). This might require a small C++ implementation in `src/cli/trader_cli.cpp` or directly in `src/memory/redis_manager.cpp` exposed via CLI.
    *   **Action (Droplet):** `./build/src/cli/trader-cli metrics import output/metrics/EUR_USD_metrics.json` (or similar command if `import` is not explicit)
    *   **Verification (Droplet):** Use `redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379` and check keys related to `EUR_USD` model parameters (e.g., `HGETALL model:EUR_USD:latest_metrics`).

-   [ ] **3.3: Enable the Pair for Trading**
    *   **Problem:** The system needs to know which pairs are active for trading.
    *   **Component:** `src/trading/dynamic_pair_manager.cpp` exposed via `trader-cli`.
    *   **Action (Droplet):** `./build/src/cli/trader-cli pairs enable EUR_USD`
    *   **Verification (Droplet):** `./build/src/cli/trader-cli pairs list` should show EUR_USD as `ENABLED` or `TRADING`.

-   [ ] **3.4: Launch the Autonomous Trader**
    *   **Problem:** The core trading execution service needs to be running.
    *   **Component:** `./run_trader.sh` (a wrapper for `build/src/apps/oanda_trader/quantum_tracker`).
    *   **Action (Droplet):**
        ```bash
        tmux new -s trader # Start a new tmux session
        ./run_trader.sh    # Run the trader within tmux
        # Press Ctrl+B then D to detach from tmux
        ```
    *   **Reference:** `QUICKSTART.md` mentions `./run_trader.sh`. `AGENT.md` and `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` confirm `quantum_tracker` as the main app.
    *   **Verification (Droplet):** Check terminal output for `[Bootstrap] Dynamic bootstrap completed successfully!` and `[QuantumSignal] 🚀 MULTI-TIMEFRAME CONFIRMED SIGNAL: EUR_USD BUY`. Also, `tail -f logs/trading_service.log` (or `output/quantum_tracker.log`) should show live trading activity.

---

## PHASE 4: SYSTEM MONITORING & ONGOING OPERATIONS

**Objective:** Establish routines for continuous monitoring, weekly retraining, and system maintenance.

-   [ ] **4.1: Monitor the Live System**
    *   **Problem:** Ensure trading service is healthy and performing.
    *   **Action (Droplet):**
        ```bash
        tmux attach -t trader # Re-attach to trader session
        # Observe live logs and output
        # In a new SSH session:
        ./build/src/cli/trader-cli status
        ./build/src/cli/trader-cli pairs list
        ```
    *   **Reference:** `QUICKSTART.md` and `SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md` describe these monitoring steps.
    *   **Verification:** Confirm consistent trading signals and no critical errors in logs.

-   [ ] **4.2: Implement Weekly Retraining Cycle**
    *   **Problem:** Models need to be updated weekly with fresh data.
    *   **Action (Local Machine):** Schedule a cron job or manual weekly execution of:
        ```bash
        source OANDA.env
        python train_manager.py fetch-all # Update data cache
        python train_manager.py train-all # Retrain all pairs (check `train_manager.py` for --all functionality)
        ./scripts/sync_to_droplet.sh      # Sync new models
        # Then, on droplet, restart trading service (docker-compose restart sep-trader)
        ```
    *   **Reference:** `QUICKSTART.md` mentions `python train_manager.py train-all`.
    *   **Verification:** Models on droplet should reflect new `trained_at` timestamps.

-   [ ] **4.3: Establish Regular Log Review & Maintenance**
    *   **Problem:** Proactively identify issues and prevent disk space exhaustion.
    *   **Action (Droplet):** Daily review of `logs/` (or `output/`) directory for errors. Implement log rotation if not already configured by Docker.
    *   **Reference:** `OPTIMIZED_ARCHITECTURE.md` suggests daily PostgreSQL backups.
    *   **Verification:** Ensure no critical errors accumulate.
