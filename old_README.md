## 4. Technical Proofs of Concept

The capabilities of the SEP Engine have been rigorously validated through a series of formal proofs of concept. These tests provide empirical evidence for the engine's performance, mathematical soundness, and predictive power.

### 4.1. Foundational Capabilities

*   **POC 1: Datatype-Agnostic Ingestion & Coherence:** Demonstrated that the engine can process any file format (text, binary, etc.) as a raw byte stream and produce a meaningful coherence score that accurately reflects the data's internal structure (repetitive, random, or semi-structured).
    *   **Document:** [`poc_1_agnostic_ingestion_and_coherence.md`](docs/proofs/poc_1_agnostic_ingestion_and_coherence.md)

*   **POC 2: Stateful Processing & State Clearing:** Proved the engine can maintain its internal state across multiple runs to build a historical context of patterns, and that this state can be explicitly cleared for reproducible analysis.
    *   **Document:** [`poc_2_stateful_processing_and_clearing.md`](docs/proofs/poc_2_stateful_processing_and_clearing.md)

*   **POC 3: Executable File Analysis:** Confirmed the engine's robustness by successfully analyzing a compiled binary executable and producing a mid-range coherence score, correctly identifying its semi-structured nature.
    *   **Document:** [`poc_3_executable_analysis.md`](docs/proofs/poc_3_executable_analysis.md)

### 4.2. Performance and Mathematical Soundness

*   **POC 4: Performance Benchmarking:** Established a baseline processing speed of ~27 microseconds for a small file, proving the core algorithms are exceptionally fast but also revealing a non-linear scalability issue that was subsequently addressed.
    *   **Document:** [`poc_4_performance_benchmark.md`](docs/proofs/poc_4_performance_benchmark.md)

*   **POC 5: Metric Compositionality:** Validated a critical mathematical property of the coherence metric. The test showed that the coherence of a large data chunk is virtually identical to the averaged coherence of its smaller constituent chunks, proving the metric is stable, predictable, and suitable for streaming analysis.
    *   **Document:** [`poc_5_metric_compositionality.md`](docs/proofs/poc_5_metric_compositionality.md)

### 4.3. Financial Application

*   **POC 6: Predictive Backtesting:** Demonstrated the engine's end-to-end capability to process real financial time-series data, generate pattern-based trading signals, and produce a quantifiable (though unoptimized) alpha. This test validated the entire CUDA-accelerated pipeline and established a solid framework for future strategy refinement.
    *   **Document:** [`poc_6_predictive_backtest.md`](docs/proofs/poc_6_predictive_backtest.md)
*   **CUDA Verification**: A suite of tests to verify the CUDA build and runtime configuration, as well as the end-to-end signal generation pipeline.
    *   **Document:** [`cuda_verification.md`](docs/cuda_verification.md)

3. **`pattern_metrics_test`** ✅ - Core pattern algorithms (8 tests)
4. **`quantum_tracker --test`** ✅ - End-to-end headless validation
5. **`pme_testbed`** ✅ - Real OANDA data backtesting (47.24% accuracy)

- **Financial backtesting** producing measurable alpha generation
 - **Docker hermetic builds** eliminating environment dependencies

### Local Installation

Run `install.sh` to set up all required packages. When CUDA support is
enabled (default) the script now installs `cuda-toolkit-12-9` so `nvcc` is
available for native builds. Use `--no-cuda` to skip CUDA dependencies and
`--minimal` for a lightweight install.

```bash
./install.sh --minimal
```

The script installs Python packages system-wide using `--break-system-packages`
to satisfy Ubuntu 24.04's managed environment restrictions. It also builds the
`sep-engine-builder` Docker image so `./build.sh` can run immediately.
