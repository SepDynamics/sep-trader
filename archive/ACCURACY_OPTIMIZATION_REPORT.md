## Current Best Implementation (Experiment 011)

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis Approach
The most successful approach combines:

1. **Autocorrelation-based Coherence**
   ```cpp
   // Enhanced coherence with 3-candle lag optimization
   double autocorr = 0.0, variance = 0.0;
   int lag = 3, window = std::min(10, (int)i);
   q_p.coherence = variance > 0 ? 
       std::min(1.0, std::max(0.0, 0.5 + 0.5 * (autocorr / variance))) : 0.5;
   ```

2. **Multi-Timeframe Temporal Coherence**
   ```cpp
   // 5-minute and 15-minute timeframe alignment validation
   if (std::abs(metric.coherence - tf5_coherence) < 0.1 && 
       std::abs(tf5_coherence - tf15_coherence) < 0.1) {
       temporal_coherence = 1.15; // 15% boost for alignment
   }
   ```

3. **Volume-Weighted Confirmation**
   ```cpp
   double volume_factor = 0.85 + 0.3 * (candle->volume / avg_volume);
   volume_factor = std::max(0.7, std::min(1.4, volume_factor));
   ```

### **Running the Best System**
```bash
# Build and run current best approach
./build.sh && ./build/examples/pme_testbed_phase2 Testing/OANDA/O-test-2.json | tail -15
```

## Technical Improvements Archive

### 1. Enhanced Coherence Calculation
```cpp
// Before: Oversimplified volatility-based
q_p.coherence = 1.0 / (1.0 + candle.high - candle.low);

// After: Autocorrelation-based market structure analysis
double autocorr = 0.0, variance = 0.0;
int lag = 3; // 3-candle lag optimal for forex
// [Complex autocorrelation calculation...]
q_p.coherence = variance > 0 ? 
    std::min(1.0, std::max(0.0, 0.5 + 0.5 * (autocorr / variance))) : 0.5;
```

### 2. Multi-timeframe Stability Analysis
```cpp
// Before: Simple price change
q_p.stability = (candle.close - candle.open) * 10000;

// After: Trend consistency across timeframes
double short_trend = 0.0, medium_trend = 0.0;
// 3-candle vs 10-candle trend alignment analysis
bool trends_align = (short_trend * medium_trend) > 0;
double trend_ratio = std::abs(short_trend) / std::max(0.0001, std::abs(medium_trend));
// [Volatility-adjusted stability calculation...]
```

### 3. Shannon Entropy Implementation
```cpp
// Before: Misused as phase
q_p.phase = std::abs(candle.close - candle.open) / (candle.high - candle.low + 1e-6);

// After: True Shannon entropy of price movements
std::vector<int> bins(5, 0); // 5 movement categories
// [Price movement categorization and entropy calculation...]
double entropy = 0.0;
for (int count : bins) {
    if (count > 0) {
        double p = count / 10.0;
        entropy -= p * std::log2(p);
    }
}
q_p.phase = entropy / std::log2(5.0); // Normalize to [0,1]
```

### 4. Dynamic Signal Thresholds
```cpp
// Before: Fixed thresholds
double buy_threshold = 0.55;
double sell_threshold = 0.55;

// After: Volatility-adaptive thresholds
double volatility_multiplier = 1.0 + (avg_volatility * 10000 - 10) * 0.02;
double buy_threshold = base_buy_threshold * volatility_multiplier;
double sell_threshold = base_sell_threshold * volatility_multiplier;
```
