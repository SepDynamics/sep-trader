# SEP Engine - Quantum-Enhanced Trading Signal Platform

## Current Status: Core Metrics Refinement

The SEP Engine has achieved **complete mathematical validation** and is now undergoing a series of performance enhancements to increase prediction accuracy from **47.24% to a target of 70%+**. The current development phase focuses on refining the core metrics (coherence, stability, entropy) through the implementation of **trajectory-based damping**.
