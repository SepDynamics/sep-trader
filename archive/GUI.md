# SEP Quantum Signal Tracker - GUI Interface Specification

**Status:** Production-Ready, Undergoing Performance Enhancement  
**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Validation:** 100% test coverage, Core metrics refinement in progress

---

## Overview

The SEP Quantum Signal Tracker provides a comprehensive real-time trading interface built with ImGui/ImPlot. It is currently being updated to integrate the new trajectory-based damping metrics, which will enhance signal stability and provide more reliable visualizations.

## Development Status & Next Steps

The GUI is fully operational and validated with the original metric calculations. The next phase of development will focus on integrating the new trajectory-based damping metrics.

### GUI Development Roadmap
- [ ] **Display Damped Values**: Update the "Quantum Metrics" and "Latest Quantum Signal" panels to display the new damped values for coherence, stability, and confidence.
- [ ] **Visualize Trajectory Paths**: Add a new visualization panel to show the trajectory path of a signal as it converges to a damped value. This will provide insight into signal stability.
- [ ] **Confidence Score Display**: Integrate the new confidence score from trajectory matching into the performance dashboard.
- [ ] **UI for New Features**: Add UI elements to support future enhancements like multi-timeframe analysis and multi-asset intelligence.

**See [TODO.md](TODO.md) for the complete, detailed development roadmap.**
